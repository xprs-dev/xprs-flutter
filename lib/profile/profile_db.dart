/*
 * Central SQLite opener for profile databases + the in-memory keyring of
 * unlocked profiles (docs/plan-encrypted-storage.md, Phase 2).
 *
 * Every `sqlite3.open()` on a database that lives under a profile folder
 * MUST go through [openProfileDb]. For plain profiles it behaves exactly
 * like `sqlite3.open`. For encrypted profiles (a `keyslot.json` exists in
 * the profile root) it applies the per-database SQLCipher key derived from
 * the profile master key, or throws [ProfileLockedException] when the
 * profile has not been unlocked yet.
 *
 * The native library is SQLCipher on every platform
 * (sqlcipher_flutter_libs); it opens plain SQLite databases identically
 * when no key is set, so unencrypted profiles are unaffected.
 *
 * io-only: do not import from web-shared code.
