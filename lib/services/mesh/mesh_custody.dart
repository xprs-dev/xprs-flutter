/*
 * mesh_custody — wires the MSP session FSM (mesh_session.dart) into the live
 * app: session lifecycle per GATT link, and the delegate that answers the
 * FSM's questions from the SCF store, the mesh table and (Stage 2) the bulk
 * spool.
 *
 * BleService owns the radios and calls in on three events only:
 *   onLinkUp / onLinkDown — a GATT link appeared/died (either role);
 *   onFrame               — bytes arrived that demuxed as MSP (0x4D 0x01).
 * Everything mesh-side happens here; ble_service_io stays transport-only.
 *
 * The existing connection model is one client link + one served central at a
 * time, so the manager holds at most two sessions (dialer + served).
