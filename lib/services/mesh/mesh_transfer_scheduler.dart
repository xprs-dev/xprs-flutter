/*
 * mesh_transfer_scheduler — decides when to dial whom (docs/mesh.md §6).
 *
 * A 10 s tick walks the work list and opens at most one GATT custody session
 * at a time:
 *
 *   1. We hold in-transit mail whose target (or route next-hop) is dialable
 *      → dial that peer and flush.
 *   2. A neighbor's beacon trailer advertises pending mail and we haven't
 *      visited it recently → dial in and let the symmetric session pull
 *      (this is how mail is fetched off server-only nodes like the ESP32).
 *
 * Politeness: per-peer exponential backoff (30 s → 5 min) after failed dials,
 * a quiet period after every clean session, and no dialing at all while any
 * session is live. The transports stay free for broadcast most of the time —
 * sessions are short bursts, resume handles the rest.
