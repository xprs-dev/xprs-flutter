/**
 * BLE 5 extended advertising + scanning, used as a SHARED connectionless
 * broadcast bus for every subsystem (Reticulum announces AND APRS group chat).
 *
 * One advertising set, MULTIPLEXED: many phones cannot sustain two concurrent
 * extended advertising sets, and two independent writers of one set just clobber
 * each other's data. So callers register keyed frames (each with a subtype + a
 * TTL) and a single rotation round-robins setAdvertisingData among the active
 * frames, dropping them when they expire. APRS messages and RNS announces are
 * sparse, so each frame still gets plenty of on-air time.
 *
 * MethodChannel  com.xprs.app/ble5      : supported / advertiseFrame /
 *                                               removeFrame / stopAdvertise /
 *                                               startScan / stopScan
 * EventChannel   com.xprs.app/ble5_scan : inbound frames as a map
 *                {addr:String, rssi:Int, subtype:Int, data:ByteArray}
 *
 * Wire framing of the manufacturer data (company id 0xFFFF):
 *   [0x3E marker][subtype][payload...]
 * Subtypes in use: 0x55 = Reticulum packet, 0x41 = APRS broadcast parcel.
