# XPRS, eXtended Packet Radio System

XPRS carries position, movement, weather, telemetry and messages between
stations over licence-free spectrum, amateur bands and the internet. It
extends and modernizes APRS. A packet is at most 250 bytes of `key:value`
text, readable on sight, signed by the key that generated the sender's
callsign, and the same on every bearer -- LoRa, Bluetooth, WiFi, HF/VHF/UHF
or the internet. No licence is needed on licence-free spectrum; on amateur
bands it operates under amateur rules -- plain text, a government-issued
callsign, no ciphertext (sections 9.4 and 33).

# Part I. Foundations

Why the network exists, the rules every field obeys, where a callsign
comes from, what a packet looks like on the wire, and how a packet is
named without the name ever being transmitted. Everything after this
part leans on these five sections.

## 1. Purpose

XPRS is APRS with Store and Forward: provides an alternative for both
licensed and unlicensed radio frequencies. The design is built with three
decades of experience from APRS with features for the modern times. APRS proved that a small text packet, heard by everyone and repeated
by volunteers, is enough to build a live map of who is where, doing what,
needing what. XPRS keeps that idea whole and rebuilds the parts that
three decades of use showed to be limits:

- **Identity was asserted, never proven.** Any station could transmit any
  callsign. XPRS signs packets with a key the station holds, so authorship is
  checkable (section 9) -- and a licensed callsign can be bound to a key and
  proven live on air (section 18).
- **Delivery was hope.** A packet missed was a packet gone. XPRS adds custody
  -- stations carry mail for the absent and hand it over with signed receipts
  (section 13) -- and history, so a station away for four days asks for the
  days it missed (section 25.2).
- **The internet side was one central system.** APRS-IS sees every packet,
  and everyone depends on it. XPRS replaces it with archivers each station
  CHOOSES, federated by directories rather than by copying each other's
  traffic (section 36) -- no archiver holds the network, every archiver can
  point across it.
- **Content stopped at 67 characters.** XPRS carries files of any size by
  content hash -- described, found, fetched in pieces, or inline when tiny
  (section 6.7) -- with the packet layer never carrying a byte it cannot
  afford.
- **One band, one plan.** XPRS is bearer-neutral: LoRa, Bluetooth, WiFi,
  HF/VHF/UHF, wired networks and the internet, each governed by its own
  airtime arithmetic (section 31), with a documented way for a pair to move
  their long business off the shared channel (section 23.7).

The prerequisites changed too. APRS requires amateur spectrum and an issued
callsign -- correct for a licensed service, and excluding everyone without a
licence. XPRS runs the same design on Bluetooth and LoRa in the ISM bands, on
WiFi and on the internet, with identity derived from a keypair generated on
the device; licensed operators keep their callsigns and their bands, and the
two meet under APRS rules where they meet (sections 9.4 and 33).

The format itself follows the most expensive lesson APRS taught. APRS
accumulated its encodings one field at a time: four incompatible position
formats, weather as fixed-width digits inside a position report, telemetry
whose units arrive in separate messages, and a mixture of feet, knots, miles
per hour, Fahrenheit, hundredths of an inch and tenths of a millibar. Each
addition was constrained by a packet that was already full. XPRS is one
syntax, readable on sight, with room to grow (section 2).

### 1.1 The actors

The same words recur through this document, and each names a ROLE -- one
station is usually several of them at once, and every one of them is
somebody's ordinary device rather than appointed infrastructure.

| Actor | What it is | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **operator** | the person; holds the key their stations sign with, answers for what they transmit | 3, 9 |
| **station** | one device speaking XPRS under a callsign; an operator's phone, tracker and desktop are stations sharing a base callsign | 3.1 |
| **relay** (APRS: digipeater) | repeats a packet on the medium it heard it, within the hop budget, appending itself to `via:` | 13.1-13.2 |
| **carrier** | holds a message in custody for a station that is absent, and hands it over -- with a signed receipt -- when it can | 13.3-13.7 |
| **gateway** (APRS: iGate) | republishes packets onto something that is not XPRS -- an archiver, APRS-IS, the internet -- under the scope rules, and publishes who it hears so the absent stay reachable | 13.11.3, 36.1, 36.8 |
| **file server** | holds content-addressed files and serves them by hash (`serve:files`, `cmd:file`, `q:have`) | 6.7, 24 |
| **archiver** | keeps packets and answers for them: the spool of what it heard (re-aired on `cmd:history`), the publications of its depositors, and mail held for recipients (`t:mailbox hold:` names one deliberately). Every station is one at its own scale; `serve:archive` announces the role to others | 24, 25.2, 36 |
| **group** | an address several stations read -- a name, not a boundary, and not a station | 6.3, 26 |

The table is descriptive, not a licence scheme: a phone in a pocket is a
station, a relay when it repeats, a carrier when it holds, a gateway the
moment it has both a radio and the internet. What a station DOES for others
it advertises with `serve:` (section 24), and what it is obliged to do is
nothing (section 31.3) -- every role here is volunteered and bounded by its
operator's budgets.

---

## 2. Design rules

1. Every packet is a list of `key:value` fields separated by one space. There
   are no positional fields, no binary framing and no escaping.
2. Every packet declares its type in the first field, so a station never has to
   guess what it is holding.
3. Every key has a declared value type (section 4.3). A reader knows the shape
   of a value before reading it, and a key's meaning never varies with the
   packet it appears in.
4. Any field may appear anywhere and any field may be absent. Adding a field
   never changes how an existing field is read.
5. One packet type carries every kind of observation. New data means a new key,
   never a new packet type.
6. Nothing is defined out of band. No receiver requires prior state to read a
   packet.
7. Every measurement carries its unit, so no value on the wire is ambiguous
   and no receiver has to assume one.
8. An unknown key is skipped and an unknown packet type is ignored, in both
   cases without error.
9. A station asks for what it wants in `q:` and answers with the same words in
   `s:`. There is one vocabulary, not one per direction.
10. Values are text. Compression is not used.

A packet is readable without a decoder:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:net starts in ten minutes
```

78 bytes. A person reads it, and so does a five-line parser.

---

## 3. Callsigns

An XPRS callsign is `X1`, `X2`, `X3`, `X4` or `X5` followed by two to five
characters derived from the holder's public key:

```
X1 = person or operator
X2 = movable station: a ship, an aircraft, a bus, a car
X3 = fixed station, relay or unattended equipment
X4 = automated device, operated by a controller (section 25.7.1)
X5 = group (section 26)
```

A group holds a keypair like anything else, so it gets a callsign like anything
else. What differs is only who holds the private half: a person for `X1`, a
machine for `X2` and `X3`, the controller that operates the device for `X4`,
and whoever administers the group for `X5`.

`X2` and `X3` split on one question: is the station going anywhere. An `X2`
moves -- a ship, an aircraft, a bus, a car -- so its position is a reading
that expires and is worth asking for again. An `X3` is where it was: a relay
on a roof, a buoy on a mooring, a repeater on a hill. A reader may cache an
`X3`'s whereabouts and plan around them; an `X2`'s whereabouts are traffic.
The choice is made at key generation and is a statement of intent, not a
promise the network checks -- a fixed station trucked to a new site keeps its
callsign and announces from where it now stands, and `site:` (section 23)
still says per announcement whether a station stays put. Everything a station
does in this document -- relaying, carrying, archiving, being owned and
commanded (section 25.9) -- an `X2` does as an `X3` does; the prefix states
what its position means, not what it may do.

Those characters are taken from the bech32 encoding of the key, so the letters
`b`, `i` and `o` and the digit `1` never appear in them.

**How many characters is the holder's own choice, and four is the default.** A
station that never chooses shows four, which is what every self-generated
callsign in the field is. The choice is made once, when the key is generated,
and is then fixed: the callsign is how the holder is addressed and stored, and
a station that changed it would be a different station to everyone who had
heard it.

Callsigns are **always uppercase** and are **not a fixed length**. A callsign
issued by a radio authority is equally valid on the wire, including a suffix:

```
t:message f:CT1ABC-9 d:G0XYZ/P ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:gate is closed, use the east path
```

89 bytes. Nothing in this format assumes a callsign length.

An XPRS callsign is a label, not an identity, and a shorter one is a weaker
label:

| characters | callsigns | two holders collide after | forging one costs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 1,024 | ~40 holders | ~1,024 keypairs |
| 3 | 32,768 | ~226 holders | ~32,768 keypairs |
| 4 | 1,048,576 | ~1,283 holders | ~1,048,576 keypairs |
| 5 | 33,554,432 | ~7,259 holders | ~33,554,432 keypairs |

Collisions can be produced deliberately at any of these lengths -- at two
characters, in about a thousand tries. A receiver that needs to establish
identity verifies a signature against the full public key (section 9). No
authority issues, revokes or vouches for an `X1`, `X2`, `X3`, `X4` or `X5`
callsign.

That last sentence has a consequence on the air: **a self-generated callsign may
never be transmitted on licensed spectrum**, where identifying the station is a
condition of the licence. Section 9.4.1 states the rule and section 9.4.2 shows
how an operator ties a callsign that *was* issued to them to the key they sign
with.

### 3.0.1 A callsign is matched whole, never by prefix

Because the characters are a prefix of the key's encoding, one key can derive
four different callsigns: a holder whose key encodes to `qpzr8...` could show
`X1QP`, `X1QPZ`, `X1QPZR` or `X1QPZR8`. They are **four different labels, and
the holder wears exactly one of them.**

The order of operations is fixed, and inverting it would break section 3.1:

```
strip the device suffix first, then compare the bare callsign as a whole string

X1ABCD-1  and  X1ABCD-2   the same person on two devices
X1AB      and  X1ABCD     different labels, even from one key
```

A station answers to its own bare callsign and to its own suffixed forms, and
to no other truncation of its key. A receiver never resolves a callsign with a
prefix match.

Checking that a callsign *could* have come from a key -- recomputing the bech32
encoding and comparing that many characters -- does not establish which length
the holder chose, since all four truncations of one key pass such a test. What
makes a callsign canonical is the identity announcement that declares it
(section 10.6), which is signed.


### 3.1 One person, several devices

The same person runs a phone, a tablet, and a node in the shed. All three hold
the same key and show it at the same length, so all three derive the same
callsign -- and on the air they are one callsign saying three different things.

APRS answered this with an SSID: `CT1ABC-9`. XPRS keeps that notation, because
it is the one every operator already reads, and changes what sits underneath it.

**The bare callsign is the person. A suffix is one of their devices.**

```
X1A67X      the person, on whatever device is in reach
X1A67X-1    one of their devices
X1A67X-2    another
```

Numbers run `-1` to `-99`. `-0` is never written: the bare form already means
the person. The suffix costs two or three bytes on `f:` and on `d:`, and nothing
anywhere else.

#### 3.1.1 Choosing a number, without anyone to ask

A device starts bare and stays bare while it is alone -- most stations never
number themselves at all.

It learns it is not alone the moment it hears a beacon (section 10.6) carrying
**its own callsign and a different key**. Two devices of one person share the
person's key; they do not share the key their own destination is derived from,
and on a beacon that difference is visible as `lx:`:

```
t:observation f:X1A67X-1 link:ble peers:2 lx:5463d9bc93aebda57d1f704a3cfbee80
t:observation f:X1A67X-2 link:ble peers:2 lx:23698e7593f05e2053f5183580e2cf98
```

77 bytes each. Each device then takes **the lowest number it has not heard in
use**, and when two would take the same one, the device whose own key sorts
lower keeps it and the other picks again. Both sides compute that from what they
have already heard, so there is no negotiation, no registry, no coordinator, and
no state that can be lost -- only a rule that two devices apply to the same
facts and reach the same answer.

A number, once adopted, is kept across restarts. A device that has been alone
for a long time may drop back to bare, and nothing breaks if it does not.

#### 3.1.2 What the numbers mean

APRS gave its SSIDs conventional meanings, and a generation of operators reads
them fluently: `-9` is the car, `-7` is the handheld, `-13` is a weather
station. XPRS keeps those meanings for `-1` to `-15`, unchanged, so an operator
who has been reading them for twenty years reads ours correctly and a gateway
maps both ways without a table of its own.

| Suffix | APRS convention | XPRS `type:` it usually goes with |
|---|---|---|
| *(bare)* | primary / home station | -- the person |
| `-1` to `-4` | generic, digipeater | `digi`, `node` |
| `-5` | other networks, smartphone | `portable` |
| `-6` | special activity, satellite, camping | `portable` |
| `-7` | handheld | `portable` |
| `-8` | boats, RV, second mobile | `boat`, `sailboat` |
| `-9` | primary mobile | `car` |
| `-10` | internet gateway | `node` |
| `-11` | balloon, aircraft, spacecraft | `balloon`, `airplane`, `glider`, `drone` |
| `-12` | trackers, DTMF, RFID devices | `drone`, `node` |
| `-13` | weather station | `wx` |
| `-14` | trucker, full-time driver | `truck` |
| `-15` | generic, digipeater | `digi` |

**`-16` to `-99` mean nothing at all, and that is the extension.** APRS stopped
at 15 because four bits was what it had. We have room, so the numbers above 15
are plain serials for a person with more devices than the conventions have names
-- a fourth tablet is not a *kind* of thing, it is the fourth one.

**Where the two disagree, `type:` wins.** A suffix is a hint for people and for
gateways; `type:` (section 35) is the machine-readable answer, and APRS never
had one:

```
t:observation f:X1A67X-9 type:car link:ble peers:2 lx:5463d9bc93aebda57d1f704a3cfbee80
```

86 bytes. **A receiver never infers what a station is from its suffix when
`type:` is present**, and never rejects a station for wearing a number that
disagrees with it. The conventions are there to be helpful, not to be enforced.

This also improves the numbering above: a device that knows its own `type:`
**prefers the conventional number for it** when that number is free. A phone in
a car self-numbers to `-9` without anyone typing anything, and an operator who
has never read this document still guesses right.

#### 3.1.3 What is addressed to whom

| `d:` | Reaches | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `X1A67X` | the person, on whatever device is reachable | everything ordinary |
| `X1A67X-2` | that one device | what only that machine can answer |

Ordinary traffic names the person, because a person is not their tablet:

```
t:message f:X1RD89 d:X1A67X ts:2026-08-12_17:28:52 m:on my way
```

62 bytes. Every device of that person shows it, and the sender does not have to
know or care which screen its reader is in front of.

A suffix is for when the machine is the point -- the photos are on the tablet,
the sensor is wired to the shed:

```
t:message f:X1RD89 d:X1A67X-2 ts:2026-08-12_17:28:52 m:the tablet has the photos
```

80 bytes.

**Commands are the other way round.** `cmd:door-open` addressed to a person is
meaningless -- a person is not a door -- so a command (section 25) names a
device:

```
t:command f:X1A67X-1 d:X1A67X-2 ts:2026-08-12_17:28:52 cmd:status
```

65 bytes. A station receiving a command addressed to the bare callsign may
refuse it, and should, unless it is the only device wearing that callsign.

**A station accepts a packet addressed to its own suffixed name or to the bare
callsign, and no other.** Everything a receiver keys on a *person* -- a thread,
a reputation, a block, a follow -- keys on the bare callsign, so numbering a
device never splits a conversation in two.

#### 3.1.4 Two devices, one recipient

Both will answer, and that is correct rather than a fault to suppress. A receipt
(section 13.7.1) names the device that sent it:

```
t:receipt f:X1A67X-1 d:X1RD89 r:40f357 s:ack sig:<60 characters>
t:receipt f:X1A67X-2 d:X1RD89 r:40f357 s:ack sig:<60 characters>
```

109 bytes each, both naming the one message in `r:`. The sender collapses them
on that identifier: one message, delivered -- and, if it cares to look,
delivered to two of the three devices that person carries.

Mail held for a bare callsign (section 13.3) is discharged by handing it to
**any** device wearing it. The person has their message; the carrier's job is
finished. Getting that message onto their *other* devices is not the mesh's
business -- it is the same key on all of them, and their own software can settle
it between themselves.

#### 3.1.5 What a suffix is not

It is not authentication, and nothing should be built as though it were. Every
device of one person holds the same private key, so any of them can sign as that
person and any of them can claim any number. A suffix distinguishes devices that
are cooperating, never devices that are competing.

The device's real name on the wire is `lx:` -- a destination derived from a key
that device alone holds. When it genuinely matters which machine is being
addressed, that is what proves it; the digits after the hyphen are a convenience
for people.

Which is the difference from APRS worth stating plainly. There the SSID was
typed by the operator and meant something by convention. Here the **person is
proven by the key**, the **device is proven by `lx:`**, and the suffix exists so
a human can say which one they mean.

---

## 4. Packet

```
key:value key:value key:value ...
```

- A key is 1 to 8 characters, lowercase letters and digits, beginning with a
  letter, followed by `:`.
- A value contains no space, and is never empty.
- Fields are separated by exactly one space.
- Order is free, except that `t:` is first and `m:`, when present, is last.
- An unknown key is skipped along with its value.

The maximum packet is **250 bytes on every transport**. This fits one LoRa
packet, one BLE5 extended advertisement, and the store-and-forward buffer of the
smallest station. Content that does not fit is split into parts (section 6.6),
never compressed.

`m:` is the one field whose value may contain spaces, which is why it is last:
everything after `m:` is the message. It needs no delimiter and no escaping, so
a message may contain spaces, colons, URLs and any punctuation.

| `file` | `ref` | content hash and type of a referenced file |
| `name` | `label` | filename, when the extension is not enough (section 6.7.1) |
| `ph` | `ref` | content hash of a file's piece list (section 6.7.2) |
| `count` | `int` | on `t:file kind:folder`, how many files a listing holds (6.7.3); on an archiver's `serve:archive` announcement, how many RECORDS it holds -- never how many callsigns (24.0.1) |
| `b` | `b64` | a small file's bytes, inline (section 6.7.4) |
| `ih` | `label` | BitTorrent infohash, 40 hexadecimal characters (section 6.7.5) |
| `have` | `label` | what a station holds of a file: `full`, a bitfield, or a fraction (section 7.1) |
| `off` | `qty` | byte offset a `cmd:file` transfer resumes from (section 25.2) |
| `x` | `b64` | sealed body |
| `xr` | `b64` | hidden parts of a redacted packet (section 9.2.1) |
| `sig` | `base85` | signature |
| `k` | `bech32` | public key, in `t:identity` and `t:challenge` |

### 4.2 Packet types

| `t:` | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `message` | a message, to a station, a group, or anyone in range |
| `observation` | an observation: position, movement, weather, telemetry |
| `receipt` | a receipt or an answer to a request |
| `reaction` | a reaction to another message |
| `request` | a request for data another station holds |
| `identity` | an identity announcement, binding callsign to public key |
| `track` | a point in a named track (section 14) |
| `sos` | a call for help (section 15) |
| `info` | a notice about conditions (section 17) |
| `blog` | a published post (section 19) |
| `poll` | a question put to everybody, with the choices (section 28) |
| `file` | what a file is, so it can be wanted (section 6.7.1) |
| `report` | a claim that a packet is spam or abuse (section 29) |
| `place` | somewhere useful that is not the sender (section 30) |
| `status` | a short post about the sender, now (section 27) |
| `passage` | where a vessel is going (section 20) |
| `event` | something happening at a time and place (section 21) |
| `offer` | what a station has (section 22) |
| `need` | what a station wants (section 22) |
| `channel` | a frequency a station uses (section 23) |
| `mailbox` | stations that hold mail for the sender (section 13.12) |
| `service` | what a station does for others (section 24) |
| `command` | asks a station to do something (section 25) |
| `result` | what happened to a command |
| `moderate` | an act of authority in a group (section 26) |
| `challenge` | a challenge to prove a callsign (section 18) |
| `response` | the answer to a challenge |
| `warning` | a warning about a hazard (section 16) |
| `ping` | a reachability test |
| `pong` | a reply to `ping` |

An unknown type is ignored. It is never an error and is never displayed as a
message. Types not listed here are reserved (section 21).

### 4.3 Value types

The type is fixed by this document and is never transmitted.

| Type | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `int` | digits, optional leading `-` | `210` |
| `dec` | digits, optional leading `-`, optional single `.` and fraction | `-9.1393` |
| `enum` | one lowercase word from a list given with the key | `foot` |
| `words` | one or more lowercase words separated by commas | `ack,read` |
| `label` | lowercase letters, digits and `-`, at least one character | `field-day` |
| `labels` | one or more `label`, separated by commas | `field-day,photos` |
| `call` | uppercase letters, digits, `-` and `/`; a group name has the same form | `CT1ABC-9` |
| `path` | one or more `call`, separated by commas | `X32DVA,CT1ABC-9` |
| `hex6` | exactly 6 lowercase hexadecimal characters | `399227` |
| `time` | `YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS`, UTC | `2026-08-08_14:26:40` |
| `offset` | `+HH:MM` or `-HH:MM` | `+05:45` |
| `coord` | two `dec` separated by a comma, latitude then longitude | `38.7223,-9.1393` |
| `ratio` | two digits `1` to `9` separated by `/`, position then total | `2/3` |
| `epoch` | two `int` separated by a dot, boot counter then seconds | `7.4210` |
| `scope` | `local`, `global`, or ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes separated by commas | `PT,ES` |
| `lang` | an ISO 639-1 code, optionally `/` and a region | `PT/BR` |
| `nick` | 1 to 16 ASCII letters, digits, `-` and `_` | `joao-brito` |
| `clock` | `HH:MM:SS`, a time of day in UTC | `20:00:00` |
| `money` | an amount with an ISO 4217 code, optional leading `~` and `/` period, or one of `offers`, `swap`, `free` (section 22.2) | `~25EUR/day` |
| `qty` | a number followed immediately by its unit (section 10.9) | `48km/h` |
| `ref` | 43 base64url characters (a SHA-256, no padding), a dot, 1 to 8 lowercase alphanumerics | `nyxKz...L4Q.jpg` |
| `b64` | base64url, no padding | `pQ4m9xT2vB8kR` |
| `bech32` | a bech32 string | `npub1qz3n7...` |
| `base85` | 60 characters, base85, no space | |
| `text` | any bytes, spaces included | `heading south on the N8` |

A value that does not match its declared type is skipped, as an unknown key is.
A packet is never rejected as a whole because one field is malformed. One
character is removed before the type is checked: the block character `█`
marks a redacted portion (section 9.2.1), and a reader strips it and reads
what remains.

### 4.4 Numbers

The decimal separator is a dot. A comma is never part of a number.

```
c:14.2        14.2 degrees
c:-3.5        3.5 below zero
a:11240       eleven thousand two hundred and forty metres
rh:0.4        four tenths of a millimetre
```

This is not a preference between conventions. A comma is already structural in
this format: it separates latitude from longitude in `pos:38.7223,-9.1393` and
it separates words in `q:ack,read`. A station writing `temp:14,2` for 14.2, or
`alt:11,240` for eleven thousand, produces a packet that reads as two values.

- The decimal separator is `.`, always, in every field and every locale.
- **There is no thousands separator.** `alt:11240`, never `alt:11,240`.
- A negative number carries a leading `-`. A positive number carries no sign.
- A number has at least one digit before the dot: `0.4`, never `.4`. It never
  ends in a dot.
- No exponent notation.
- **A measurement carries its unit** (section 10.8). The number rules above
  govern the digits; the unit follows them with no space: `alt:3048m`,
  `spd:48km/h`, `temp:-3.5C`.

Trailing zeros are significant, because the number of decimal places states the
precision claimed (section 10.1). `temp:14.0` says the reading was measured to a
tenth; `temp:14` says it was not.

Software that formats numbers according to the operator's locale must be
overridden before transmission. This is the most likely way for an
implementation to emit packets that every other station silently misreads,
since `14,2` is correct in most of Europe and is a different packet here.

### 4.5 Labels

`tag:` carries topic labels chosen by the sender. They let a receiver file,
filter or search a packet without reading it.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 tag:vacation m:back on Monday, radio off until then
```

102 bytes. Several labels are separated by commas:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 tag:vacation,photos m:the coast near Sagres
```

94 bytes. There is no limit on how many labels a packet carries beyond the
250-byte packet itself. It applies to any packet, not only messages:

```
t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 temp:14.2C ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 tag:field-day
```

90 bytes.

**A label contains no space.** No field value may contain a space, `m:` alone
excepted, and `tag:` is not that exception. A label is lowercase letters,
digits and `-`, at least one character, and words are joined with `-` rather
than spaces: `tag:field-day`, never `tag:field day`, which would end the field
at the space and leave `day` to be read as a malformed field and skipped.

Labels are lowercase so that a receiver matching them does not have to decide
whether `Vacation` and `vacation` are the same label. They are chosen freely
and this document assigns none: unlike `q:` and `s:`, whose words are a fixed
vocabulary because both ends must agree on what they mean, a label means
whatever the people using it agree it means.

A receiver that does not recognise a label keeps it and displays it. Labels are
never a routing decision: `d:` says where a packet goes, and a label never
changes that.

### 4.6 Content warnings

`cw:` warns a receiver what a packet contains before it renders it.

```
t:blog f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 title:haulout cw:injury m:the hand is fine now, photos below
```

99 bytes. `cw:` costs nine bytes and takes one or more words, separated by
commas:

| Word | Contents |
|---|---|
| `adult` | sexual content |
| `nudity` | nudity that is not sexual |
| `violence` | violence |
| `injury` | graphic injury, blood, surgery |
| `death` | death, human or animal |
| `drugs` | drug or alcohol use |
| `language` | profanity |
| `spoiler` | spoils something the reader may not have seen |
| `flashing` | rapid flashing or strobing |
| `other` | something else the sender thinks needs a warning |

`flashing` is not a matter of taste. Rapid flashing triggers seizures in
photosensitive epilepsy, and a receiver that autoplays is the case the warning
exists for:

```
t:info f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 kind:event cw:flashing ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:fireworks over the harbour at ten
```

117 bytes.

It is a closed vocabulary rather than a `tag:`. A label means whatever the
people using it agree it means (section 4.5), which is fine for a topic and
useless for a filter: a receiver cannot hide adult content reliably if the word
for it is whatever each sender chose, in whatever language. These ten words a
receiver can act on, and translate.

It is several words rather than one rating, because a single scale cannot say
why. Somebody avoiding graphic injury is not the same person as somebody
avoiding sexual content, and neither is the reader who needs `flashing`.

Four rules, each covering a way this otherwise fails without anyone noticing.

**It covers the whole packet, including any `file:`.** The attachment is usually
the thing that needed warning about:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cw:adult,nudity file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg m:not for the group chat
```

144 bytes.

**It is repeated on every part** of a split message, not only the first. Parts
arrive in any order (section 6.6), so a warning carried once is a warning the
receiver may read after it has already displayed part two.

**It stays in cleartext when the body is sealed.** `cw:` is an envelope field
and is never moved inside `x:`, because a receiver has to decide whether to
render before it decrypts:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cw:adult x:<64 characters> sig:<60 characters>
```

191 bytes. What the packet contains is disclosed; the content itself is not.

**A relay never strips it**, and **its absence is not a guarantee**. An unmarked
packet is unmarked, not safe. A receiver that treats a missing `cw:` as a
promise has built a filter on the honesty of strangers.

`cw:` marks content. It does not regulate it: what is lawful to send or offer
differs by country, and that is the operator's business and not the format's.

```
t:offer f:X1QZ3N pos:38.6902,-9.4012 kind:other cw:adult price:~40EUR/h ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:massage, by appointment
```

120 bytes.

### 4.7 Language

`lang:` says what language the text is in. It is optional and **the default is
English**, so a packet without it is read as English.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 lang:PT m:a rede comeca daqui a dez minutos
```

94 bytes, nine of them the field. An ISO 639-1 code in uppercase.

A regional variant is added after a slash, which is worth the three bytes where
it changes the words rather than the accent:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 lang:PT/BR m:a rede comeca daqui a dez minutos
```

97 bytes. `PT/BR` and `PT` are the same language and not the same
vocabulary, and `EN/US` and `EN/GB` disagree about enough words to matter in a
warning.

Uppercase and the slash both follow conventions already in the format: values
are uppercase where they are codes rather than words, and `/` already separates
in `n:2/3` and in a callsign like `G0XYZ/P`.

`lang:` describes `m:` and nothing else. A packet with no text does not need it,
and the keys, the packet types and every enum value in this document are English
regardless -- they are identifiers rather than prose, and translating them would
break every receiver.

A receiver that cannot read the language still relays it. Translation is a
presentation matter, and a station that dropped what it could not read would
make the network useless to anybody in a minority language.

### 4.8 Time

`ts:` is written the way a person reads it, in UTC:

```
ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

The `_` keeps it one field.

`ts:` is always UTC, so two packets from opposite sides of the world are ordered
by comparing them directly, with nothing to convert first.

`tz:` optionally carries the sender's offset from UTC, so a reader can show the
local time it was written at:

```
t:message f:VK2XYZ d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 tz:+11:00 m:good morning from Sydney
```

87 bytes. The receiver reads 14:26 UTC, and knows it was 01:26 the next morning
where the sender was standing. Offsets of 30 and 45 minutes exist, so the
minutes are written out rather than assumed to be zero.

`tz:` is presentation only. It never changes `ts:`, never takes part in an
identifier, and a station that ignores it loses nothing but the courtesy.

A packet that may be relayed or carried **must** have a time field. A carried
packet can be delivered days later, and an undated position is plotted as
current. Two alternatives exist for stations without a clock (section 10.7).

### 4.9 Extending the format

A new field takes an unused key, declares its type, and is placed anywhere.
Receivers that do not know the key skip it and its value. No existing field
moves, no packet type is added, and no version is negotiated.

Keys beginning with `z` are reserved for private and experimental use and are
never assigned by this document.

```
t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 temp:14.2C zpm:8 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

82 bytes. Every existing receiver reads `temp:14.2` and `ts:`, skips `zpm:8`,
and is otherwise unaffected.

### 4.10 JSON

A packet is a flat list of `key:value` pairs, so it is a JSON object already.
The conversion needs no schema, no table and no knowledge of any packet type.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-18_09:15:00 m:arrived at the marina
```

```json
{"t":"message","f":"X1QZ3N","d":"X1RD89","ts":"2026-08-18_09:15:00",
 "m":"arrived at the marina"}
```

**Wire to JSON.** Read fields left to right. Each is a key, a `:`, and a value.
Split on the FIRST colon only -- a value may contain colons, and `m:` usually
does. Fields are separated by exactly one space, except that everything after
` m:` is the message, spaces included. A key is 1 to 8 lowercase letters and
digits and appears once (section 23.4), so it is a valid and unique JSON member
name with nothing to escape.

**Every value is a JSON string.** `temp:14.2C` is `"14.2C"` and not `14.2`: the
unit is part of the value (section 4.4), and a reader that converts to a number
has silently thrown away what the number meant. `peers:2` is `"2"`. There are
no JSON numbers, no booleans and no nulls anywhere in a packet -- a value is
never empty (section 4), so a key that carries no information is simply absent.

**JSON to wire.** Write `t:` first, `m:` last where present, one space between
fields, no space after a colon. The result is a packet, subject to the 250-byte
limit like any other.

**The one thing to be careful with is order.** A JSON object is unordered by
definition, and the identifier in section 5 is a SHA-256 over the wire bytes.
Converting a packet to JSON and back can therefore reorder the middle fields
and produce a DIFFERENT identifier for the same message. Two consequences,
and neither is a limitation of JSON so much as a rule about where the
identifier lives:

- Compute an identifier from the wire, never from the JSON. A tool that stores
  packets as JSON should store the identifier alongside, or keep the original
  bytes.
- A converter that must round-trip byte-exactly has to preserve field order:
  an ordered map, or an array of `[key, value]` pairs.

For reading, filtering, indexing and shipping packets between programs, the
object form is enough and the order does not matter. It matters when a
signature or an identifier has to still be true afterwards.

---

## 5. Message identifiers

**Every packet has an identifier, and it is never transmitted.** Both ends
compute it from the packet itself, byte for byte:

1. Take the packet as transmitted: the UTF-8 bytes on the wire.
2. Remove the `sig:` field and the `via:` field where present. Removal means
   deleting the key, its value, and the ONE space before the key, leaving
   every other byte untouched. Both fields sit before `m:` (which is last and
   swallows everything after it), fields are separated by single spaces, and
   `t:` is always first -- so the removal is a plain byte deletion and the
   result reads as if neither field had been written.
3. Compute SHA-256 over the remaining bytes.
4. The identifier is the first 6 characters of the digest in lowercase hex.

To reply to a packet, compute its identifier this way and put it in `r:`.
Verifiable at a shell:

```
$ echo -n 't:message f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:OK' | sha256sum
ca5413...        ->  id ca5413
```

Nothing announces its own identifier. A packet already carries who sent it and
when, so the identifier is free.

The timestamp is what makes this work. Hashing content alone would give every
`OK` ever sent the same identifier, and `OK` is the most common message on any
network:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:OK   ->  ca5413
t:message f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:27:22 m:OK   ->  08ba5f
t:message f:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:OK   ->  25f96d
```

Sender, second and text together are unique in practice.

A split message is the one place to be careful: every PART has its own
identifier, and the message's identifier is computed from the reassembled
packet as section 6.6 describes -- `n:` removed, the `m:` values joined. A
reply names the reassembled identifier, never a part's.

Two fields are excluded and both for the same reason: they change while a
packet is in flight. Signing must not alter the identifier of what was signed,
and a carrier appending itself to `via:` must not turn one message into a
different one. Everything else is included, which is what makes the identifier
exact.

`f:` and `ts:` alone would not be enough. A station beaconing position and
weather in the same second would give both packets one identifier, and a reply
naming it would be ambiguous. Hashing the whole packet costs nothing, because
none of it goes on the wire.

`r:` carries an identifier when a packet refers to another: a reply, a reaction,
a receipt, or a withdrawal of the sender's own earlier packet (section 17.2).

---

# Part II. Correspondence

Messages and replies, questions and answers, the words reserved for
them, and the signatures and sealed bodies. The part two people use to
talk.

## 6. Messages

### 6.1 Broadcast

No `d:`. The packet is addressed to whoever is in range.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:anyone near the north gate?
```

71 bytes.

### 6.2 Direct

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:meet at the bridge at six
```

78 bytes, identifier `de9780`.

### 6.3 Group

`d:` holds a group name. Group names are uppercase, 1 to 16 characters. A
station tells an open group from a person or a machine by the `X` prefixes of
section 3 and the characters that follow, so an open group may not be named like one of
those -- at any of the lengths section 3 allows, which is why a four-character
group name such as `X1AB` is now as unusable as `X1ABCD` was.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:net starts in ten minutes
```

78 bytes, identifier `399227`. Anyone may post to `LISBOA` and nobody may be
removed from it, which is the whole of what an open group is.

A group that needs a member list holds a keypair and is addressed by the `X5`
callsign derived from it (section 26). Everything in this section applies to it
unchanged:

```
t:message f:X1RD89 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:net starts in ten minutes
```

78 bytes, identifier `89a9c8`. The same size as the line above it, because a
closed group costs an ordinary packet nothing.

### 6.4 Replies

`r:` names the packet being replied to, which may be any packet carrying
content (section 6.5).

```
t:message f:X1RD89 d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:36:00 r:399227 m:I'll be late, start without me
```

92 bytes. The reply has its own identifier, computed the same way, so it can be
replied to in turn. A receiver that has not seen the parent still displays the
reply, marked as answering a message it does not hold.

**Below the first level a reply also names the thread it belongs to**, with
`root:`:

```
t:message f:X32DVA d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:40:00 root:399227 r:8536fb m:no rush, we start at nine
```

99 bytes. `r:` keeps exactly the meaning it had -- the packet being replied to
-- and `root:` names the packet the whole conversation hangs from.

A first-level reply carries `r:` alone, because its parent *is* the root. Only
deeper replies carry both, so the eleven bytes are spent only where they buy
something.

What they buy is the ordinary case on this network rather than an unusual one.
**A lost middle packet orphans everything beneath it**: with `r:` alone, a
receiver holding a reply whose parent it never heard cannot tell which
conversation the reply belongs to, and a thread arriving out of order over three
bearers reassembles into fragments. `root:` makes that reply filable anyway --
shown under the right conversation, in the right place, with a gap where the
missing packet was.

### 6.5 Reactions

```
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:399227 add:like
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:399227 remove:like
```

46 and 49 bytes. `add:` states what is being added and `remove:` withdraws that
same thing, so neither has to be read as the negation of the other. A reaction
carries no `m:`. It is counted once per callsign, is idempotent, is not
displayed as a message and raises no notification.

### 6.5.1 Replying, quoting and passing on

Three things a social network needs, and the format already had two of them.

**A reply is `r:`** (section 6.4), and it works on any packet carrying content.

**A quote is a reply that says something.** There is no separate mechanism and
there does not need to be: `r:` names what is being quoted and `m:` is the
comment on it.

```
t:status f:X32DVA ts:2026-08-08_14:40:00 r:399227 m:worth reading, he is right about the feed point
```

99 bytes. A client renders the parent above the comment; a client that never
heard the parent shows the comment and says so, which section 6.4 already
requires of every reply.

**Passing something on unchanged is `add:repost`.**

```
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:399227 add:repost
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:399227 remove:repost
```

48 and 51 bytes. It is a reaction because it has a reaction's shape exactly: one
per callsign, idempotent, withdrawable, and no text of its own.

**What travels is the original packet, not a copy of it.** A repost says "this
belongs in front of the people who follow me", and the thing itself is re-aired
with `f:`, `ts:` and `sig:` untouched -- the same act as a history replay
(section 25.2.1), and safe for the same reason: duplicates collapse on the
derived identifier, so a post reposted by nine stations is still one post.

That is the difference from a quote worth understanding. **A repost adds nothing
and changes nothing**, so it cannot misrepresent what it carries; the signature
still proves who wrote it and the reposter's callsign appears only on the
reaction. A quote is the sender's own packet with their own words, and they
answer for those.

**A reply and a reaction are different acts, and not every packet takes both.**

Every packet has an identifier (section 5), so `r:` can name any of them. What
differs is whether naming it means anything:

| Packet type | Reply | React |
|---|---|---|
| `message`, `status`, `blog`, `observation`, `track`, `passage`, `event`, `offer`, `need`, `channel`, `service`, `place`, `poll`, `file`, `warning`, `info` | yes | yes |
| `sos` | yes | **no** |
| `reaction`, `receipt`, `request`, `challenge`, `response`, `identity`, `mailbox`, `command`, `result`, `moderate`, `report`, `ping`, `pong` | no | no |

A weather observation, a warning, a blog post, an offer and a channel
announcement can all be replied to and reacted to. That is what deriving
an identifier for every packet rather than only for those carrying a message.

**A call for help takes replies and never reactions.** Answering an `sos` is
`t:receipt` with `s:ack` (section 11.5), which says a station heard it and is a
different thing from approving of it. A reaction adds nothing that mechanism
does not already carry, spends airtime on a channel that must stay clear, and a
counter of likes under somebody's call for help is grotesque. A receiver
discards one.

The bottom row is protocol machinery rather than content, and a receiver
**ignores** a reply or reaction naming any of it.

A reaction is excluded because a reaction to a reaction is not a thing anyone
means, and a reply to one is a reply to the wrong packet: the reaction already
names what it was about, and that is what should be answered.

A **track point** is replied to and reacted to like anything else, but people
mean the track rather than the point. A receiver attributes both to the track,
which `f:` and `track:` identify (section 14), and shows them once against the
line instead of against `seq:7`.

A **challenge and its response** are excluded for a stronger reason. They are a
two-party authentication exchange, valid for sixty seconds, and the only thing
that should ever name a challenge is its own response. Anything else pointing at
one is noise at best, and at worst an invitation to treat a security exchange as
a conversation.

### 6.5.2 Mentioning somebody

A mention is `@` followed by a callsign, written in the text where a person
would write it:

```
t:status f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:thanks @X1RD89 and @X32DVA for the relay last night
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:@CT1ABC-9 is the one to ask about the repeater
```

94 and 99 bytes. **There is no key for this**, and there should not be: a field
would carry the same information twice, once for the parser and once for the
reader, and cost bytes to do it. A receiver that has never heard of mentions
still shows `@X1RD89` and a person still understands it, which is the property
design rule 2 exists to protect. Other formats need a tag because their content
is opaque to the protocol; `m:` is not opaque to anybody.

**The parse rule is one line.** `@` followed by one or more `call` characters --
uppercase letters, digits, `-` and `/` -- ending at the first character that is
not one of those. A trailing `-` or `/` is punctuation and not part of the
callsign.

**Uppercase is what makes it safe.** Callsigns are always uppercase (section 3),
so `write to me@example.com` contains no mention, and the rule needs no escape
character, no delimiter and no exception.

**There is no limit on how many.** The packet limit is already the limit, and it
is a better one than any number this document could pick: mentions compete with
the message for the same 250 bytes, so a station that tags thirty people has no
room left to say anything to them.

Two things follow. A station that finds its own callsign after an `@` **raises a
notification**, which is the entire point of the convention. And **anyone may
mention anyone**: there is no consent, no blocking and no way to prevent it, so
a client must let its operator mute a callsign whose mentions it does not want.

A mention is also the strongest signal a station has for deciding what to keep
(section 31.3). Being named is what makes a packet worth more than the traffic
around it, and until now nothing in this format said so.

### 6.6 Long messages

A message longer than one packet is split into numbered parts. Every part
carries the same `ts:` and its own `n:`.

```
t:message f:X3RLY7 d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 n:1/3 m:The repeater on the hill is down.
t:message f:X3RLY7 d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 n:2/3 m:We swapped the antenna feed this morning
t:message f:X3RLY7 d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 n:3/3 m:and it is back up, but only just.
```

92, 99 and 92 bytes.

- Reassembly is keyed on `(f, ts)`. The parts of one message share a timestamp,
  so no identifier has to be transmitted to bind them.
- Only `m:` is split -- with one exception: a packet carrying inline file bytes
  splits `b:` instead (section 6.7.4), and those parts are joined with nothing
  rather than a space, because base64url has no spaces to split at.
- Every field except `m:` and `n:` is repeated on each part, so a receiver can
  read the envelope of any one of them.
- **A sender splits only at a space, and never inside a word.**
- **A receiver joins the `m:` values in order with exactly one space between
  them.** No part begins or ends with a space, so there is never a doubled space
  and never a missing one.
- **The identifier is that of the packet the parts reassemble into**: every
  field from the first part, `m:` replaced by the joined text, and `n:` removed,
  hashed as section 5 says. A reply names that, never an individual part. Each
  part has its own identifier and none of them is the message's.
- Incomplete sets are held for 10 minutes and then discarded. A partial message
  is never displayed.
- Parts may arrive in any order. A repeated part number is ignored.
- **A set is limited to 9 parts**, so `n:` is always three characters and the
  last part is at most `n:9/9`. A message that does not fit in nine parts is
  sent as a file (section 6.7) rather than split further: at that size the
  content is a document, and a receiver that loses one of twenty parts has
  waited a long time to be told it has nothing.

### 6.7 Files

`file:` is the SHA-256 digest of the file contents as 43 base64url characters
(no padding), a dot, and 1 to 8 lowercase alphanumeric characters giving the
type.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg m:the antenna after the storm
```

133 bytes. The caption is an ordinary `m:` field.

base64url because the digest is the single most repeated expensive value in the
format and 43 characters against 64 for hex is 21 bytes returned to every
packet that carries one. A receiver also accepts the digest as 64 lowercase
hexadecimal characters -- the earlier form of this field -- and treats the two
as the same reference; a sender emits base64url.

The hash identifies the file exactly, so any station holding those bytes can
satisfy the reference and a receiver can verify what it obtained. The extension
is advisory: it indicates how to present the content and never affects
identification. A receiver that does not recognise an extension offers the file
as an opaque download.

How the bytes are transferred is outside this specification. A reference remains
valid whether the file arrives over the same radio, over the internet, or on
physical media. What THIS document defines is everything around the bytes: how
a file is described (6.7.1), how a large one is verified in pieces and a folder
of them is listed (6.7.2), how a whole folder is synchronised (6.7.3), how a
small one rides the packets themselves (6.7.4), how anyone asks who holds one
(section 7, `q:have`), and how one is fetched or deposited (section 25.2,
`cmd:file` and `cmd:put`).

### 6.7.1 Saying what a file is

A hash identifies a file perfectly and describes it not at all. `t:file` is the
packet that says what the bytes are, so somebody who does not already know can
decide whether to want them:

```
t:file f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg size:240kB tag:radio m:the finished dipole, feed point centred
```

154 bytes. `m:` describes it, `tag:` files it under topics, and `size:` is a
quantity with its unit like every other measurement in this format.

**`size:` is the field that earns its bytes.** `cmd:file` (section 25.2) asks a
station to send the content, and on a bearer that owes seconds of silence per
packet the difference between a 240 kB photograph and a 40 MB video is the
difference between a fetch and a mistake. Knowing the size first is how a
station declines politely instead of starting something it cannot finish.

Two optional fields complete the description:

- `ph:` -- a `ref`: the content hash of the file's **piece list** (6.7.2), which
  is itself an ordinary content-addressed file. Its presence says this file can
  be verified piece by piece, which is what lets several stations serve parts
  of it at once and a station holding half of it serve that half.
- `name:` -- the filename, 1 to 64 characters with no space (the value rule of
  section 4). Optional because the extension already advises presentation and a
  name costs bytes the packet may not have.

```
t:file f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg size:240kB ph:qA7dTf2mWx9bK4pZcV0yLuJ3gRhN8sE5iDoQ6vXaB1M.xfl tag:radio sig:<60 characters> m:the finished dipole
```

250 bytes -- a fully described, signed, piece-verifiable file sits exactly at
the packet limit. Adding `name:` pushes it over, and that is fine: a `t:file`
splits like any packet (section 6.6), and a description is not beacon traffic.

A description packet is also the only thing that makes a file findable by
**words**. `file:` alone can be looked up by somebody who already has the hash
and by nobody else; a `t:file` gives a station something to index, so "that
photo of the dipole" is a question with an answer.

`t:file` describes and never delivers. The bytes travel however they travel
(above), and a description whose content nobody holds is a description of
something lost -- worth keeping anyway, because it says what was lost.

### 6.7.2 Listings: a folder's files, and a file's pieces

One text format serves two needs, because a folder of files and a file's pieces
are the same shape: a list of hashes with sizes. A **listing** is a UTF-8 text
file of LF-terminated lines:

```
XFL1
Uc3nRw8kFa5xPd1qGz7mYb0tJe6vHs2iLoA9XfCqK4E.gpx 18kB ridge track.gpx
nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg 240kB dipole finished.jpg
```

The first line is the magic. Every other line reuses the grammar the packets
already have: a reference (or a bare 43-character hash), a `qty` size, and --
because names contain spaces -- the name last, running to the end of the line,
exactly the rule that puts `m:` last in a packet.

- **A folder listing**: `ref size name` per line, lines sorted bytewise by
  name. Sorting makes the listing deterministic: the same folder content always
  produces the same listing bytes, therefore the same hash, therefore one
  listing however many people publish it.
- **A piece list**: `hash size` per line, no name, no extension on the hash, in
  piece order -- here the order IS the content. Every piece is `size:` long
  except the last. Recommended piece sizes: 64 kB, 256 kB for files of 4 MB
  and up, 1 MB for files of 64 MB and up. A 240 kB photograph's piece list is
  four lines and about 200 bytes; a 4 GB video's is 4096 lines and about
  200 kB -- either way a small fraction of the file it verifies.

A listing is itself an ordinary content-addressed file: described by a
`t:file`, fetched with `cmd:file`, asked after with `q:have`, deposited with
`cmd:put`, and verified against the reference that named it. Nothing new
travels.

**A station that verified pieces 0 to 411 of 900 holds pieces 0 to 411, may
say so (section 7), and may serve them.** That is the rule that turns a crowd
of partial downloads into a working swarm: nobody has to finish before being
useful, and the most-copied pieces of a popular file are available from many
stations at once.

### 6.7.3 Syncing a folder

A folder is published by describing its listing -- the existing `t:file` with
the reused `kind:` field, and nothing new:

```
t:file f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 file:qA7dTf2mWx9bK4pZcV0yLuJ3gRhN8sE5iDoQ6vXaB1M.xfl kind:folder count:34 size:210MB sig:<60 characters> m:Trip photos 2026
```

207 bytes. `count:` says how many files, and `size:` is the folder's TOTAL
payload -- so a station knows what "everything" costs before fetching anything.

The whole flow is vocabulary this document already has. Fetch the listing
(`cmd:file` on the `.xfl` reference), read the names, sizes and hashes, then
fetch any or all members (`cmd:file` per reference, `q:have` to find nearer
holders first). Every member is verified against its own hash on arrival, so a
folder assembled from six different stations is exactly the folder that was
published.

**Sync is snapshots.** A changed folder is a new listing with a new hash,
announced with a new `t:file`. Files that did not change keep their hashes, so
a receiver holding the previous snapshot diffs two listings line by line and
fetches only what is new -- incremental synchronisation with no mutation
protocol, no version numbers and nothing to negotiate. The old listing remains
a valid description of the old folder, which is what an archive wants anyway.

### 6.7.4 A small file inline

Below a certain size, describing a file costs more than sending it -- the rule
of section 36.2, "send whichever is smaller", applied to content. `b:` carries
the file's bytes as base64url in the `t:file` that describes it:

```
t:file f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 file:Uc3nRw8kFa5xPd1qGz7mYb0tJe6vHs2iLoA9XfCqK4E.png size:240B b:iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8z9AAAAAdklEQVQ4y2P8z8BQ
```

A larger inline file splits per section 6.6 with one added rule: **`b:` splits
like `m:`, but the parts are joined with nothing** -- base64url contains no
spaces, and a space would corrupt it. A 240-byte icon, signed, in three parts:

```
t:file f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-17_10:00:00 n:1/3 file:Uc3nRw8kFa5xPd1qGz7mYb0tJe6vHs2iLoA9XfCqK4E.png size:240B b:PtYgjmUhBel31iEl2hpChYgCfrL1spNxnyVmihA_2O76UMFxFkM_R5Kjp1vRt-1fjORS_6ilI8ihN5KXSc7Tvo_hBKqFYY_kv5ZJr3J1TWDtkwtDDb-xHKas1VOqg6YYZYn9ZhyiA4uo
t:file f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-17_10:00:00 n:2/3 file:Uc3nRw8kFa5xPd1qGz7mYb0tJe6vHs2iLoA9XfCqK4E.png size:240B b:RgnatmUdjAWtGSU8po-799NksnRH9ucAUsdMlHUvTCQCyEZDz_TddJ8HyS5SUkCnD8zRA9a9SkpXz9w3QlY7Zkuvqdt7s8Stqcbnr3yBdGBLEPH1qhT61qtc4xatws8phP9nhFyJfm5d
t:file f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-17_10:00:00 n:3/3 file:Uc3nRw8kFa5xPd1qGz7mYb0tJe6vHs2iLoA9XfCqK4E.png size:240B sig:<60 characters> b:i4PzJ59FHz5r1pY4OjE2jBMptUsGr7CmY-uCu3ZR
```

250, 250 and 215 bytes. Every field except `b:` and `n:` repeats on every
part, so any single part says whose file, which file and how big. Reassembly
is the section 6.6 procedure with the empty join: concatenate the `b:` values
in `n:` order, decode, hash, compare against `file:`. There is no offset and
no per-part checksum, because `n:` is the index and the whole-file hash is the
only integrity that matters at this size.

With these fields a part carries 140 characters of `b:` and the signed last
part 75, so nine parts carry 1195 characters: **an inline file tops out at
896 bytes.** Thumbnails, avatars, QR payloads, keys and configuration fit;
anything larger travels as section 6.7 says. The two never mix -- a file is
inline or it is fetched, and a receiver that decodes `b:` checks it against
`file:` and, on a match, holds the file like any other holder.

The reason this lane exists is the bearer that has no other: on a LoRa-only
network there is no bulk connection to move bytes over, and a packet is the
only vehicle there is. 896 bytes is a real photograph thumbnail or a real
public key, and either arriving over 40 km of nothing is worth nine packets.

### 6.7.5 The BitTorrent bridge

A file can additionally be offered to stock BitTorrent clients, and the trick
is that nothing extra needs to be transmitted to arrange it. The torrent for a
file is built **deterministically**: single file, named `<digest-hex>.<ext>`,
piece length the power of two nearest `size/1024` clamped between 16 kB and
4 MB, no private flag and no source field. Two stations that hold the same
bytes therefore derive the same torrent and the same infohash independently --
the swarm address is a pure function of the content.

`ih:` (40 hexadecimal characters) carries that infohash when talking to
something that cannot derive it -- a link handed to somebody's ordinary
torrent client. Between XPRS stations it is dead weight and is not sent.

The SHA-256 remains the identity throughout. The infohash addresses a swarm;
whatever the swarm delivers is verified against `file:` like bytes from any
other source, and fails like them if it lies.

---

## 7. Asking and answering

`q:` says what the sender wants back. `s:` answers using the same words.

```
q:ack        confirm this reached the device
q:read       confirm the operator read it
q:pos        send your position
q:batt       send your battery level
q:identity   send your public key
q:sign       sign a receipt confirming you read this
q:pong       reply to this reachability test
q:have       say whether you hold the file named by file:
q:state      send your device state: state:, level:, target: (section 25.7)
q:mail       say how much mail you hold, for the callsign in only: (13.12.3)
```

Several are separated by commas. An unknown word is ignored, so `q:pos,bat,co2`
still returns position and battery from a station that has never heard of CO2.

Absence of `q:` means nothing is expected back, so silence is never ambiguous --
with one exception, and it is the common case: a direct message between two
stations that have exchanged one before is acknowledged without being asked
(section 13.7.1). Everything else still answers only what `q:` requested.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 q:ack,read m:did you get the keys?
```

85 bytes, identifier `9821a4`.

The answers, naming that identifier in `r:`:

```
t:receipt f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N r:9821a4 s:ack
t:receipt f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N r:9821a4 s:read
```

42 and 43 bytes. `s:ack` is sent when the message reaches the device, `s:read`
when the operator reads it. A station that does not track reading sends `s:ack`
only, and the sender sees exactly which of the two requests was satisfied.

A request for data is the same exchange without a message:

```
t:request f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 q:pos,batt
t:observation f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N pos:38.7810,-9.2043 batt:64% ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 s:pos,batt
```

61 and 94 bytes. A station holding only part of what was asked says so, rather
than failing:

```
t:observation f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N pos:38.7810,-9.2043 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 s:pos
```

80 bytes: position sent, battery not available, no error packet needed.

`s:no` is the one word not in `q:`, for a request a station will not or cannot
serve at all:

```
t:receipt f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 s:no
```

### 7.1 Who holds a file

`q:have` with a `file:` reference asks who holds those bytes. Broadcast, it is
the question a station asks the street before spending a fetch on somebody far
away; directed, it checks one station before asking it to serve.

```
t:request f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 q:have file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg
```

101 bytes, identifier `17d873`. A holder answers, directed, with `have:` in one
of three forms:

```
t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:41 r:17d873 s:have have:full size:240kB
t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:41 r:17d873 s:have have:412/900 size:58MB
```

86 and 88 bytes. `have:full` is the whole file. A partial holder answers the
piece bitfield as base64url, least significant bit first, **when it fits the
packet** -- up to roughly 1200 pieces -- and the fraction `have:412/900` when it
does not; the exact map travels with the transfer itself once one starts. A
station that holds nothing stays silent: on a broadcast ask, a hundred "no"s
would cost more than the answer is worth, and silence already says it
(section 7).

This is the radio's version of the claim a provider record makes on an
internet overlay: the same "I hold it", scoped to whoever can actually hear
the speaker -- which for a fetch over the street is the right scope.

55 bytes.

Any station may act on a receipt it overhears. A station holding a message for
later delivery discards its copy on hearing the matching `s:ack` **whose
signature it has verified** -- and on no other. An acknowledgement releases mail
across the whole network, so an unsigned one is a way to delete a message the
attacker never held (section 13.7.1).

---

## 8. Reserved words

`q:` and `s:` words assigned by this document: `ack`, `read`, `sign`, `pos`,
`batt`, `identity`, `pong`, `have`, `state`, `no`, `owner`, `policy`, `mail`.
Command words assigned: `history`, `file`, `put`, `set`, `interpret`, `update`.
Reactions assigned for `add:` and `remove:`: `like`, `repost`. All other words
are reserved. A word beginning with `z` is private, as a key beginning with `z`
is.

---

## 9. Signing and privacy

### 9.1 Signatures

`sig:` covers the whole packet with the `sig:` and `via:` fields and their
separating spaces removed. Position in the packet is therefore not significant,
and a verifier reconstructs the signed text by deletion.

**Both fields come out, and the reason for `via:` is not economy.** A relay
appends itself to `via:` (section 13), so a signature covering it would break at
the first hop and every relayed packet would read as forged -- on a network
whose whole point is relaying, and where signing is the default. The signed
text is therefore exactly the text the identifier is derived from (section 5),
which leaves one canonical form to implement rather than two.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 sig:<60 characters> m:net starts in ten minutes
```

143 bytes. The identifier is `399227`, the same as the unsigned packet in
section 6.3, because signing changes neither `f:`, `ts:` nor the payload.

| State | Condition |
|---|---|
| verified | signature present, valid, signer key known |
| forged | signature present and invalid |
| unverified | signature present, signer key unknown |
| unsigned | no signature |

**`sig:` may appear on any packet, and a station signs by default.**

A callsign is a label that anyone can write (section 3). Nothing else in this
format stops a station putting `f:X1QZ3N` on a packet it did not send, and for
most traffic a signature is the only thing that does. It is 65 bytes and it
should be spent unless there is a reason not to.

Default means default and not mandatory. A sender may omit it, and a receiver
must accept an unsigned packet rather than discarding it, because the network
carries traffic from sensors with no key, from stations too small to sign, and
from software written before this section. What a receiver must not do is
present an unsigned packet as though its `f:` were established.

One exception remains, and it is not economy.

A **challenge and its response** carry their own proof: the response is signed,
and the exchange is the authentication rather than something needing it
(section 18).

Everything else is signed by default, including the smallest packets:

```
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:399227 add:like sig:<60 characters>
```

111 bytes for a signed reaction, against 46 unsigned. A forged reaction
attributed to you is still an impersonation, and the extra bytes buy the same
thing they buy anywhere else.

### 9.1.1 When the signature does not fit

A signature is 65 bytes and the packet limit is 250, so a full observation can
run out of room. The weather station in section 11.3 is 193 bytes and would be
258 signed.

**Drop optional fields, never the signature.**

```
t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 temp:14.2C hum:78% press:1013.2hPa wind:3.4m/s wdir:210deg type:wx ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 sig:<60 characters>
```

197 bytes: the same station with two readings fewer, signed. A receiver
learns less and can trust what it learns, which is the better trade for a
station whose whole value is being believed.

Where the payload cannot be trimmed, split it (section 6.6) and sign the last
part, which is what a long message already does. Where neither is possible --
a single measurement that fills the packet by itself -- the sender may go
unsigned, and that is the case the "unsigned" state above exists to describe.

### 9.1.2 Computing the signature

The scheme is a short Schnorr signature over secp256k1 in the classic (e, s)
form: the challenge travels truncated to 16 bytes and the scalar in full, 48
bytes together, the smallest a secp256k1 signature can be. It uses the same
key that stands behind the station's callsign (section 3), and it is NOT
interoperable with BIP-340 verifiers -- the truncated-challenge form trades
that away for 16 bytes a packet gets back.

Two helpers, then the algorithm.

**Tagged hash** (the BIP-340 construction): `H_tag(msg) = sha256(sha256(tag)
|| sha256(tag) || msg)`, with the tag as UTF-8 text.

**Base85**: 4 bytes become 5 characters, Z85-style. The value `v` of each
big-endian 4-byte group is written as five digits base 85, most significant
first, using this 85-character alphabet (chosen to exclude the space and the
APRS-reserved `{`, `|`, `~`):

```
0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.-+=^!/*?&<>()[]%$#@,;_
```

48 bytes therefore encode to exactly 60 characters, which is what the `sig:`
value is.

**To sign**, with private scalar `d`, curve order `n` and generator `G`:

1. `m = sha256(canonical text)` -- the packet with `sig:` and `via:` removed,
   exactly as section 5 removes them. `m` is also the digest the identifier
   truncates, so one canonical form serves both.
2. Use the x-only key convention: if `d*G` has an odd y coordinate, replace
   `d` with `n - d`. Let `px` be the 32-byte x coordinate of the public
   point.
3. Draw 32 random bytes `aux`, and derive the nonce
   `k = H_XPRS/nonce(d || m || aux) mod n` (d as 32 bytes big-endian; if the
   result is zero, use one).
4. `R = k*G`; let `rx` be its 32-byte x coordinate.
5. `e = first 16 bytes of H_XPRS/challenge(rx || px || m)`.
6. `s = (k + e*d) mod n`, with `e` read as a big-endian integer.
7. The signature is `e || s`, 48 bytes; base85-encode it and place it in
   `sig:`, which `with`-inserts before `m:` so the message stays last.

**To verify**, split the 60 characters back into `e` (16 bytes) and `s` (32):
reject `s >= n`; lift `px` to the even-y point `P`; compute
`R' = s*G - e*P`; recompute step 5 over the x coordinate of `R'`; the
signature is valid when the 16 bytes match. The verifier never needs the
signer's y coordinate or the nonce -- `s*G - e*P` reconstructs `R` because
`s = k + e*d`.

Because `aux` is random, signing the same packet twice produces two different
signatures and both verify. A worked example with `aux` FIXED to 32 zero
bytes so every value is reproducible, using the toy key `d = 7` (never sign
with a toy key):

```

```

Which yields the signed packet -- note `m` above is the digest whose first six
characters are the identifier `399227` of section 6.3:

```
143  t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 sig:V<-(s&U-xL(hjs8hbML0<8nw[A)a<YeW+5_1BYlWzX.)fQYP&LeI[ZC<n4Yl m:net starts in ten minutes

The signing function in C++, with the curve and hash primitives taken from
the reader's own library (libsecp256k1, OpenSSL or equivalent -- the shapes
are stated in the comments):

```cpp

    static const char* B85 =
        "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.-+=^!/*?&<>()[]%$#@,;_";
    const Big n = curve_order();

    uint8_t m[32];
    sha256(m, (const uint8_t*)canonical.data(), canonical.size());

    Point P = ec_mul_g(d);                        // x-only key convention

```

And verification, with two more primitives from the same library --
`ec_add(a, b)` for point addition and `lift_x(x)` returning the even-y curve
point for a 32-byte x coordinate (null when x is not on the curve):

```cpp
// Verify a sig: value (XPRS 9.1.2). canonical: the packet text with sig:
// and via: removed. sig85: the 60-character value. px: the signer's 32-byte
// x-only public key. Returns true only for a valid signature.
bool xprs_verify(const std::string& canonical, const char sig85[60],
                 const uint8_t px[32]) {
    static const char* B85 =
        "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.-+=^!/*?&<>()[]%$#@,;_";
    const Big n = curve_order();

    uint8_t sig[48];                              // base85 decode, 5 -> 4
    for (int i = 0; i < 60; i += 5) {
        uint64_t v = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; ++j) {
            const char* d = strchr(B85, sig85[i + j]);
            if (!d) return false;                 // not in the alphabet
            v = v * 85 + (d - B85);
        }
        if (v > 0xFFFFFFFFull) return false;      // overfull group
        sig[(i/5)*4 + 0] = (v >> 24) & 0xff;
        sig[(i/5)*4 + 1] = (v >> 16) & 0xff;
        sig[(i/5)*4 + 2] = (v >>  8) & 0xff;
        sig[(i/5)*4 + 3] =  v        & 0xff;
    }

    Big e = big_from_be(sig, 16);                 // e(16) || s(32)
    Big s = big_from_be(sig + 16, 32);
    if (s >= n) return false;

    uint8_t m[32];
    sha256(m, (const uint8_t*)canonical.data(), canonical.size());

    Point P = lift_x(px);                         // even-y point for px
    if (P.is_null()) return false;

    // R' = s*G - e*P, computed as s*G + (n - e)*P.
    Point Rp = ec_add(ec_mul_g(s), ec_mul(P, n - e));
    if (Rp.is_infinity()) return false;
    uint8_t rx[32];  big_to_be32(point_x(Rp), rx);

    uint8_t cb[96];                               // rx || px || m
    memcpy(cb, rx, 32); memcpy(cb + 32, px, 32); memcpy(cb + 64, m, 32);
    uint8_t e2[32];  tagged_hash(e2, "XPRS/challenge", cb, 96);

    uint8_t diff = 0;                             // constant-time compare
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) diff |= sig[i] ^ e2[i];
    return diff == 0;
}
```

The reconstruction works because `s = k + e*d`, so `s*G - e*P` is
`k*G + e*d*G - e*d*G = R`; a verifier never needs the nonce or the signer's
y coordinate. The three failure modes before the math -- a character outside
the alphabet, an overfull base85 group, `s >= n` -- are rejected first so a
corrupted or hostile value never reaches the curve.

### 9.2 Encryption

`x:` carries the sealed body and replaces `m:`.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 x:pQ4m9xT2vB8kR sig:<60 characters>
```

131 bytes. `t:`, `f:`, `d:` and `ts:` stay in cleartext, so an intermediate
station can route the packet, identify the recipient and release a carried copy
on the matching receipt, without reading the content.

A later cipher suite takes a new key rather than changing this one.

### 9.2.1 Hiding parts of a message

`x:` seals a whole body. This section hides PARTS of one, the way a
released government document does: the reader sees bars where the secrets
sit, how long they are and where, and everything around them stays
readable. Those with the passphrase recover the hidden parts; everyone
else still gets a useful packet.

The author marks each secret in double parentheses -- in the text or inside
a field's value:

```
m:meet ((Max)) at ((pier2))
pos:38.7((223)),-9.1((393))
```

On the wire, every marked span becomes a run of the block character
`█` (U+2588), one per hidden character, in place:

```
m:meet ███ at █████
pos:38.7███,-9.1███
```

Redaction is visible wherever it happens -- which field, where in the
value, and how long. A bar costs 3 bytes in UTF-8, which the author is
paying for the look.

**Parsers learn the bar.** When interpreting a value, a reader removes the
block characters first and reads what remains against the declared type as
usual (an amendment to the reading rule of section 4.3, and the only one).
`pos:38.7███,-9.1███` therefore parses as `38.7,-9.1` for everyone -- a
valid position, good to about ten kilometres -- while the passphrase
recovers the metre scale. The author decides what the stripped value says,
because the author decides what stays outside the parentheses. A value
still invalid after the bars are removed is skipped like any malformed
value. Display keeps the bars; interpretation drops them.

The hidden parts travel in `xr:`, built like this:

1. The plaintext is `->` followed by the hidden pieces, one line per bar
   run, IN PACKET ORDER: field runs first, in the order the fields appear
   and the runs appear within each value, and the `m:` runs last -- which
   is the packet's own order, since `m:` is last by grammar. Nothing else
   is carried: no field names, no offsets, no lengths. The wire's bars
   already say where and how big.
2. The key is derived slowly and salted:
`key = first 16 bytes of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256(passphrase, "xprs-xr" || nonce,
100000 iterations)`. The nonce is fresh per packet, so a fresh derivation is
paid per message even by someone who knows the passphrase -- a fraction of a
second for the reader, ruin at scale for a harvester or a brute-forcer. This is
why there is one profile and no strength levels: the derivation is the
strength, and it costs everyone the same per message.
3. The cipher is AES-128-CTR: 12-byte random nonce, 32-bit big-endian block
   counter starting at zero.
4. `xr:` = base64url, no padding, of nonce || ciphertext. Fourteen bytes of
   fixed overhead plus the secrets.

Decryption succeeds when the plaintext starts with `->`. That sentinel
detects the RIGHT KEY and nothing else; tampering is the signature's job,
because `sig:` covers the bars and `xr:` like every other field. A packet
whose signature verifies but whose decryption yields garbage was not
forged -- the passphrase was wrong.

**Restoration is defended twice.** Line i substitutes bar run i, and a
line must have exactly the run's character count -- a hundred-letter line
cannot fill a three-bar hole. After substitution the field's value must
still pass its type check. A restoration failing either test is discarded
and the barred wire value stands. The blob can only ever fill the holes
the wire visibly declares, at the sizes the wire declares.

**The default passphrase is `################`** (sixteen number signs),
and the spec is plain about what it buys: obfuscation, not secrecy. Anyone
can decrypt it -- but each message still costs the full derivation, which
is what keeps a bot from harvesting a thousand redacted email addresses
for free. A secret that matters takes a real passphrase, and releasing a
passphrase later is an ordinary message or file, needing nothing new.

**Where bars are permitted.** The rule: a field that third parties act on
-- routing, relaying, custody, reassembly, verification, transfers,
channel tuning -- is never redacted; a field that only informs the reader
may be. Bars also only belong where the stripped value stays honest, which
excludes the enumerated words (half a word is no word).

Redaction is permitted in:

| Fields | What they are |
|---|---|
| `m:` | the text |
| `pos:` `alt:` `spd:` `h:` `o:` `acc:` | position and movement -- the accuracy dial |
| `dest:` | a coarse destination still steers a carried packet (13.4) |
| `temp:` `hum:` `press:` `wind:` `wdir:` `intemp:` `inhum:` | weather readings |
| `batt:` `dose:` `lifedose:` `radon:` `rf:` `efield:` `mfield:` `odometer:` | telemetry readings |
| `tag:` `title:` `name:` | content labels; unfindable without the key is the author's choice |
| `price:` `onboard:` | information between people |

Redaction is refused everywhere else, and a receiver ignores bars found
where they are not permitted (the stripped value is read; nothing is
restored there). The refusals, by reason:

- **Envelope and identity**: `t:` `f:` `d:` `ts:` `tz:` `n:` `via:` `sig:`
  `x:` `xr:` `k:` -- parsing, routing, reassembly and the crypto itself.
- **References**: `r:` `root:` -- a coarse identifier references nothing.
- **Commands and answers**: `q:` `s:` `cmd:` `arg:` `code:` `only:`
  `since:` `until:` -- stations act on these.
- **Relay and custody control**: `scope:` `urg:` `hold:` `near:` `route:`
  `serve:` -- carriers and gateways obey them.
- **Group governance**: `add:` `remove:` `grant:` `revoke:` `role:`
  `hide:` `vote:` `opt:` -- signed authority records.
- **File machinery**: `file:` `ph:` `ih:` `b:` `have:` `off:` `size:`
  `count:` -- a coarse hash is garbage and a coarse size mis-sizes a
  transfer.
- **Channel tuning**: `freq:` `mode:` `bw:` `shift:` `input:` `tone:`
  `power:` `ch:` `every:` `for:` `at:` -- a barred frequency tunes the
  wrong radio.
- **Radio diagnostics**: `link:` `busy:` `txtime:` `hears:` `peers:`
  `mail:` `lx:` `uptime:` `lifetime:` `epoch:` `seq:` `track:` -- other
  stations route by these.
- **Safety**: `cw:` `sev:` `rad:` `kind:` -- a warning warns everyone, and
  a content warning stays readable precisely when the content is not.
- **Display meta**: `lang:` `mood:` `site:` `supply:` `range:` --
  enumerated words, nothing gained.

A worked packet, with the nonce fixed to `000102030405060708090a0b` so
every value reproduces (a real sender draws it randomly). Author input as
above; four bar runs in packet order; plaintext `->223`, `393`, `Max`,
`pier2` on four lines; derived key `e7d6ef612e71fb09fd65dc71efd832c7`:

```
164  t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 pos:38.7███,-9.1███ ts:2026-08-18_17:00:00 xr:AAECAwQFBgcICQoL5tqwc_xiDDNhLVD9YLDyKZnrvw m:meet ███ at █████
```

Everyone in range reads a meeting near 38.7,-9.1 between two stations,
with the position visibly coarsened and two words visibly withheld.
Holders of the passphrase read who, which pier, and where to ten metres.

The bars leak the LENGTH of a secret -- deliberately, that is the
redacted-document look doing its job -- and an author who must hide length
pads inside the parentheses before marking. Text larger than a packet is a
file (section 6.7) and redacts the same way; nothing new travels.

### 9.3 Identity

```
t:identity f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 k:npub1qz3n7fu9j9uenmyva7ha6x9eqwymytv2847ccv4vxdmn45y50q7h7k5f sig:<60 characters>
```

171 bytes. A receiver stores the binding and uses it to verify signed packets
from that callsign. Answers `q:identity`.

**An identity announcement is signed like everything else.** An earlier draft of
this document said it was not, on the grounds that the signature would have to
be verified with the key the packet carries and was therefore circular. That
reasoning was wrong, and the nickname below is what exposes it.

A self-signature proves the sender **holds the private key**, which is not
circular and is not nothing. Without one, anybody can rebroadcast
`t:identity f:X1QZ3N k:<the real key of X1QZ3N>` with whatever else they like
attached: the callsign still derives correctly from the key (section 3), every
check passes, and the extra fields are the attacker's. With one, they cannot,
because they do not have the private half.

What the signature does not establish is entitlement to the callsign. For an
`X1`, `X2` or `X3` callsign the derivation in section 3 does that. For a callsign
issued by an authority nothing in this format does: section 18 proves that the
key holder is present, and section 9.4.2 says where entitlement is checked
instead, which is the authority's own register and not any packet.

### 9.3.1 Nicknames

`nick:` gives a callsign a human-readable name.

```
t:identity f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 k:npub1qz3n7fu9j9uenmyva7ha6x9eqwymytv2847ccv4vxdmn45y50q7h7k5f nick:joao sig:<60 characters>
```

181 bytes. One to sixteen characters: ASCII letters, digits, `-` and `_`. No
spaces, because no value except `m:` may contain one, and no accents, because
the whole format is ASCII. A name that needs more than that belongs in a
profile somewhere else, and this field is a label rather than a biography.

Three rules, and the third is the one that matters.

**It only counts when the signature verifies.** A receiver that cannot check the
signature shows the callsign and not the nickname. An unsigned or unverifiable
nickname is a claim by nobody.

**The newest verifiable announcement wins**, decided by `ts:`. A station changes
its nickname by announcing again.

**A nickname is never an address.** `d:` takes a callsign and only a callsign.
Nicknames are not unique, cannot be made unique without a registry this format
deliberately does not have, and two stations calling themselves `joao` is
expected rather than exceptional. A receiver that let a user address a nickname
would have built the spoofing surface that signing the rest of this section was
meant to close.

Show it as decoration next to the callsign, never instead of it.

### 9.3.2 A face and a line about yourself

A townhall of callsigns is a spreadsheet. `file:` gives an identity a picture
and `m:` a line of description, both optional and both signed with the rest:

```
t:identity f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 nick:joao file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg sig:<60 characters> m:sailing the Algarve coast
```

198 bytes. The picture is a **reference and not bytes** -- a content hash like
any other file in this format (section 6.7), fetched with `cmd:file` (section
25.2) if the receiver wants it and ignored entirely if it does not. A station
that never fetches an avatar has lost nothing but a picture.

**An identity announcement carries any subset of these fields, and a receiver
keeps, for each field, the value from the newest verifiable announcement that
carried it.** That rule is forced by arithmetic rather than chosen: the key
binding and the decoration together come to 262 bytes, which does not fit.

```
181  t:identity f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 k:npub1qz3n7fu9j9uenmyva7ha6x9eqwymytv2847ccv4vxdmn45y50q7h7k5f nick:joao sig:<60 characters>
198  t:identity f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 nick:joao file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg sig:<60 characters> m:sailing the Algarve coast
```

The split turns out to be the right shape anyway. The key binding is small and
must be repeated often, because a receiver that has never heard it can verify
nothing (section 18.1). The decoration is larger and changes once a year, so it
goes out rarely -- which is section 31 applied to this format's own traffic.

A packet without `k:` still verifies, against the key the receiver already holds
for that callsign. One from a station whose key is unknown is ignored, exactly
as the nickname rule above requires.

### 9.4 Permitted use by band

| Spectrum | Callsign in `f:` | Signing | Encryption |
|---|---|---|---|
| Licence-free (Bluetooth and LoRa ISM, WiFi), and the internet | any, including a self-generated `X1`, `X2` or `X3` | permitted | permitted, and is the default for direct messages |
| Licensed spectrum, including the amateur bands | **only one issued by a competent authority to the operator transmitting** | permitted | not permitted on amateur bands |

Amateur regulations prohibit obscuring the meaning of a transmission. A licensed
operator using XPRS on amateur bands is bound by that rule as on any other mode
and must not transmit `x:` there.

A signature is not encryption. It leaves the text in cleartext and establishes
only authorship, so signing is permitted on amateur bands.

An implementation able to reach amateur infrastructure must refuse to transmit a
sealed body onto it.

### 9.4.1 Only an issued callsign may transmit on licensed spectrum

**Transmitting XPRS on a licensed frequency requires a callsign issued to the
operator by a competent authority, and nothing else will do.** This is the one
rule in this document that is not ours to relax: it comes from national
regulation, it applies to the person keying the transmitter, and no property of
the format changes it.

An `X1`, `X2`, `X3`, `X4` or `X5` callsign is derived by its holder from its
own key (section 3). No authority issued it, no register lists it, and it can be
generated by anyone in a moment. That is as it should be on licence-free
spectrum, where a callsign is a label. On licensed spectrum it identifies
nobody, which is the thing an identification requirement exists to prevent, so
a packet whose `f:` is `X1`, `X2`, `X3`, `X4` or `X5` **must never be
originated onto a licensed frequency**. A licensed operator transmits under the callsign on
their licence, which the format already accepts at any length and with a
suffix.

This binds gateways harder than it binds people, because a gateway does it
automatically and at volume. **A station bridging licence-free traffic onto
licensed spectrum must drop packets from self-generated callsigns rather than
relay them.** Relaying one puts an unidentified transmission on the air under
the gateway operator's licence, and the operator, not the sender, answers for
it.

### 9.4.2 Associating an issued callsign with a key

An operator who wants their traffic to be verifiable under their real callsign
announces the binding themselves, with the identity packet of section 9.3 and
their own callsign in `f:`:

```
t:identity f:CT1ABC ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 k:npub1qz3n7fu9j9uenmyva7ha6x9eqwymytv2847ccv4vxdmn45y50q7h7k5f sig:<60 characters>
```

171 bytes. From then on their packets can carry `sig:` and a receiver can check
that the operator who announced that key wrote them.

**Be exact about what this proves**, because the temptation to read more into it
is strong. The self-signature proves the sender holds the private key for the
announced `npub`. It proves nothing whatever about entitlement to `CT1ABC`: an
`X1` callsign is checked against its key by arithmetic, an issued callsign has
no arithmetic relationship to any key, and this format has no registry and
issues no credentials. A second station can announce the same callsign with a
different key, and both announcements will verify.

| Question | Answered by |
|---|---|
| does the holder of this key write these packets | the signature, section 9.1 |
| is that key holder present right now | a challenge, section 18, on licence-free spectrum only |
| was this callsign issued to this person | **nothing in XPRS**; the authority's public register, out of band |

The last row is the honest one. Most administrations publish a searchable
licence register, and checking a name and locality against it is a human act
performed once, not a protocol exchange. What XPRS contributes is the part that
register cannot give you: that this packet, now, came from the same key as the
one you checked.

A receiver that has verified a binding out of band may mark it as such in its
own records. **It must never transmit that verdict as though it were a fact
about the callsign**, because a claim that a callsign is licensed carries far
more weight than the sender's opinion deserves.

### 9.4.3 What signing costs on the amateur bands

Amateur regulations prohibit obscuring the meaning of a transmission, and a
signature does not obscure it. `sig:` is detached: the message stays in clear in
`m:`, legible to any receiver, and the signature sits beside it as evidence
about authorship. Anyone monitoring reads the traffic exactly as they would
unsigned.

```
t:message f:CT1ABC d:G0XYZ ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 sig:<60 characters> m:net starts at eight on the repeater
```

152 bytes, lawful on an amateur band, and verifiable.

Three consequences follow, and they are the price of operating there:

- **`x:` is never transmitted on amateur spectrum.** Sealing a body obscures
  meaning, which is the prohibited act.
- **A challenge cannot be put on amateur spectrum**, because the exchange in
  section 18 works by sealing a nonce. Prove a callsign on licence-free spectrum
  or over the internet, then carry the result to the band.
- **Signing is authorship, not confidentiality.** On an amateur band XPRS can
  tell a receiver who wrote a packet and can never keep a third party from
  reading it. An operator wanting privacy uses licence-free spectrum, where
  section 9.2 applies in full.

# Part III. Observations

Positions, weather, telemetry and device readings, and two sections of
worked examples.

## 10. Observations

Position, movement, weather and telemetry share one packet type and one
vocabulary. There is no separate weather packet and no separate telemetry
packet. A weather station is a station that reports temperature in addition to
position.

### 10.1 Position

`pos:` is decimal degrees, WGS84, latitude then longitude, negative for south
and west. No hemisphere letters, no degrees-minutes-seconds, no compression.

```
p:38.7223,-9.1393
```

The number of decimal places states the precision claimed:

| Decimals | Resolution | Appropriate for |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | 1.1 km | a town |
| 3 | 110 m | a district |
| 4 | 11 m | a normal satellite fix |
| 5 | 1.1 m | a good fix or survey equipment |
| 6 | 0.11 m | rarely justified |

A station sends only the digits its fix supports, and reports measured
uncertainty separately in `acc:`.

Absence of `pos:` means the position is unknown. It does not mean zero. `0,0`
is a valid coordinate in the Gulf of Guinea.

### 10.2 Movement

| Key | Type | Meaning | Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pos` | `coord` | position | degrees |
| `alt` | `qty` | altitude above mean sea level | distance |
| `acc` | `qty` | horizontal accuracy radius | distance |
| `spd` | `qty` | speed over ground | speed |
| `dir` | `qty` | course over ground, the direction it is travelling | angle |
| `o` | `qty` | heading, the direction it is pointing | angle |
| `climb` | `qty` | vertical speed, signed | speed |

`dir:` and `o:` are different measurements and a station may report both. `dir:`
is where it is going, which is what a satellite fix gives. `o:` is where it is
pointing, which is what a compass gives. They agree on a road and disagree
wherever wind or current pushes a vehicle sideways:

```
t:observation f:X1BOA3 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 spd:6kt dir:275deg o:262degm type:boat ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

104 bytes: making 6 knots over the ground towards 275 true, with the bow held
at 262 magnetic to hold that track against the current.

A station with only a satellite fix sends `dir:` alone, which is the common
case. A station that is stationary has no course and may still have a heading:

```
t:observation f:X1CAR7 pos:38.7231,-9.1402 o:212degm type:car ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

84 bytes.

### 10.3 Weather

| Key | Type | Meaning | Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `temp` | `qty` | air temperature, outdoors | temperature |
| `hum` | `qty` | relative humidity, outdoors | proportion |
| `intemp` | `qty` | air temperature, indoors | temperature |
| `inhum` | `qty` | relative humidity, indoors | proportion |
| `press` | `qty` | barometric pressure, station level | pressure |
| `wind` | `qty` | wind speed, sustained | speed |
| `wdir` | `qty` | wind direction, the direction it blows from | angle |
| `gust` | `qty` | wind gust, peak | speed |
| `rain1` | `qty` | rainfall, previous hour | rainfall |
| `rain24` | `qty` | rainfall, previous 24 hours | rainfall |
| `solar` | `qty` | solar irradiance | irradiance |

A station reports in the unit it works in and says which it is (section 10.8).
A station holding Fahrenheit sends `temp:57.6F`; it does not convert, and the
receiver does.

**`temp:` and `hum:` are outdoors. `intemp:` and `inhum:` are indoors.** A key
beginning with `in` is the indoor counterpart of the key that follows it.

They are separate keys rather than one key with a flag saying where the sensor
sat, because a station commonly has both and would otherwise need two packets to
report what it measured at one moment:

```
t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 temp:14.2C hum:78% intemp:21.5C inhum:54% press:1013.2hPa type:wx ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

131 bytes: 14.2 outside, 21.5 in the room, one timestamp, one transmission.

A station with only an indoor sensor sends only the indoor keys, and the reading
is no longer mistaken for outside air:

```
t:observation f:X3WX01 intemp:21.5C inhum:54% age:60
```

52 bytes.

A station with one sensor that does not know where it sits sends `temp:`.
Outdoors is the default because it is the reading another station can use: an
outdoor temperature describes the air a neighbour is standing in, an indoor one
describes a room only its owner cares about.

Pressure has no indoor form. The difference across a wall is smaller than the
instrument's error, and `press:` is already defined at station level.

### 10.4 At sea

| Key | Type | Meaning | Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wave` | `qty` | significant wave height | distance |
| `swell` | `qty` | swell period | duration |
| `seatemp` | `qty` | sea surface temperature | temperature |
| `vis` | `qty` | horizontal visibility | distance |

```
t:observation f:X1BOA3 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 wave:1.8m swell:9s seatemp:18.4C vis:2km wind:11m/s type:sailboat ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

131 bytes.

These decide whether a passage happens, and nothing else in the format carries
them. Wind and pressure describe the air; a two-metre swell at nine seconds is a
different sea from a two-metre swell at four, and the number that tells them
apart is the period.

`vis:` is a distance rather than a category, so `vis:200m` in fog and `vis:20km`
on a clear day are the same measurement rather than two vocabularies.

A vessel sends what its instruments give it and omits the rest:

```
t:observation f:X1BOA3 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 wave:1.8m seatemp:18.4C type:boat ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

99 bytes.

### 10.5 Telemetry and station type

| Key | Type | Meaning | Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `batt` | `qty` | battery charge | proportion |
| `volt` | `qty` | supply voltage | voltage |
| `link` | `enum` | which bearer a reading is about (section 10.6) | |
| `busy` | `qty` | proportion of the last hour that bearer was occupied (section 10.6) | proportion |
| `txtime` | `qty` | proportion of the last hour this station transmitted | proportion |
| `hears` | `path` | callsigns heard directly, most relevant first (section 10.6.3) | |
| `peers` | `int` | how many stations are reachable in total (section 10.6.4) | |
| `mail` | `int` | messages held for other stations (section 10.6.5) | |
| `rssi` | `qty` | received signal strength | signal power |
| `snr` | `qty` | signal-to-noise ratio | signal ratio |
| `uptime` | `qty` | how long the station has run without interruption | duration |
| `lifetime` | `qty` | how long the station has run in total, across every restart | duration |
| `odometer` | `qty` | distance travelled over the station's service life | distance |
| `type` | `enum` | what the station is or is riding on, from the set in section 14.2 | |
| `fw` | `text` | the firmware version this station is running (section 25.8) | |
| `state` | `enum` | a device's principal condition, from the closed list in section 25.7 | |
| `level` | `qty` | how far, when a condition is partial (section 25.7) | proportion |
| `target` | `qty` | the setpoint a device holds a reading at (section 25.7) | |

Radiation readings -- ionizing and electromagnetic -- are their own family,
section 10.5.1.

`rssi` and `snr` describe the radio path a packet arrived on and are reported
by the receiver, in a `pong` reply. A station does not transmit its own
received signal strength.

`uptime` and `lifetime` are the station's account of its own stability, for
whoever is deciding whether to route through it or nominate it a mailbox.

```
t:observation f:X3RLY7 link:ble peers:4 mail:3 uptime:26h lifetime:38day
```

72 bytes. `uptime` resets to zero at every restart, on purpose: a
station that reboots hourly cannot claim otherwise for long. `lifetime` is
**accumulated service time** -- the sum of every period the station has been
running since it first kept records -- so it survives restarts and needs no
wall clock, which a station reporting `epoch:` (section 10.7) does not have.
It is not the calendar age of the hardware: a dongle powered one hour a day
for a year reports `lifetime:15day`, and that is the honest figure for a
station whose value is being on the air.

Both are claims, not measurements a receiver can check. Like `serve:`
(section 24.3), they say what the sender believes about itself; a receiver
weighs them against what it has observed. Coarse figures are the expected
form -- `uptime:26h` rather than `uptime:94340s` -- because the reading changes
by the second while its meaning changes by the hour, and the bytes are better
spent elsewhere.

`odometer:` is the moving station's counterpart to `lifetime:`: how far it has
travelled over its service life, in any distance unit (section 10.9). The word
is the instrument's own, so a reader needs no glossary, and the key fits the
eight characters a key is allowed exactly.

```
t:observation f:X1SHIP pos:38.7012,-9.1523 spd:12kt odometer:15420nmi lifetime:210day ts:2026-08-13_10:00:00
```

108 bytes: a ship with 15,420 nautical miles behind it across a 210-day
service record. A car reports `odometer:48213km`. Like `lifetime:` it is the
station's own account -- a receiver weighs it, not verifies it.

An observation carries a note in `m:`, the same key a message uses.

### 10.5.1 Radiation

Radiation a station can measure and a person would want to know about:
ionizing radiation from nuclear sources, and the electromagnetic fields of
transmitters and power systems. One family, one discipline, built to grow.

| Key | Type | Meaning | Quantity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dose` | `qty` | ambient ionizing dose rate -- what a Geiger counter shows | dose rate |
| `lifedose` | `qty` | ionizing dose accumulated since the station's records began | dose |
| `radon` | `qty` | radon activity concentration in the air | activity concentration |
| `rf` | `qty` | radio-frequency power density | power density |
| `efield` | `qty` | electric field strength | electric field |
| `mfield` | `qty` | magnetic flux density | magnetic flux density |

```
t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 dose:0.14uSv/h ts:2026-08-13_10:00:00
t:observation f:X3WX01 dose:0.14uSv/h lifedose:1.2mSv lifetime:38day ts:2026-08-13_10:00:00
t:observation f:X3WX01 rf:120uW/m2 efield:1.8V/m mfield:0.3uT ts:2026-08-13_10:00:00
t:observation f:X3LAB1 radon:120Bq/m3 ts:2026-08-13_10:00:00
```

80, 91, 84 and 60 bytes. Normal background dose rate is roughly `0.1uSv/h` to
`0.3uSv/h`, so `dose:2.5uSv/h` reads as anomalous on sight -- which is the
point of putting the unit on the value rather than in a manual.

**These are instrument readings, never health claims.** A receiver may plot
them, compare them against its own idea of background, and decide what it
thinks; the sender asserts only what its instrument showed. And an absent key
means *not measured*, never *safe* -- the same rule `cw:` states in section
4.6, for the same reason.

`lifedose` pairs with `lifetime:` exactly as it reads: everything the station
absorbed over the service record it is already reporting. `dose` is the now,
`lifedose` is the history.

A telemetry stream is not an alarm. A station watching a **sustained**
anomaly raises `t:warning kind:radiation` (section 16), which carries the
nine-relay budget an emergency deserves; the observation stream keeps its
ordinary three and its ordinary cadence (section 31.1).

**Counts per minute are refused.** A CPM figure is a property of the tube
that produced it and means nothing without out-of-band calibration, which
design rule 6 forbids. A station converts to dose rate before transmitting,
using its own tube's factor -- the one party that reliably knows it.

**Growing the family** costs what section 4.9 says and nothing more: a new
reading takes a new key in this table and its unit family in section 10.9
with a canonical unit -- no new packet type, no version, no negotiation. A
reading not yet adopted here travels under a `z`-key until it is. Candidates
already visible from here: an ultraviolet index, and separated beta and
neutron dose for stations with instruments that discriminate.

### 10.6 The radio itself

A station can measure the air, its battery and where it is. It can also measure
**the channel it is sitting on and the stations it can hear**, and those two
readings are what the rest of this format quietly assumes somebody has.

```
t:observation f:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 link:lora busy:41% txtime:6%
t:observation f:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 link:lora hears:X1QZ3N,X32DVA,CT1ABC-9
t:observation f:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 link:ble hears:X1PZ4Q,X32DVA
```

74, 84 and 74 bytes. No new packet type, because design rule 5 settles it: one
type carries every kind of observation, and how busy a bearer is is an
observation about a radio exactly as temperature is one about the air.

| Key | Reading |
|---|---|
| `link` | which bearer every reading in this packet is about |
| `busy` | proportion of the last hour that bearer was occupied by anybody |
| `txtime` | proportion of the last hour **this station** was transmitting |
| `hears` | callsigns heard directly on that bearer, most relevant first |
| `peers` | how many are reachable in total, so a truncated `hears:` is honest |
| `mail` | messages held for others; omitted when none. A neighbour that can reach a recipient opens a session rather than everyone airing every message |

**The window is one hour and is not stated on the wire**, because two stations
reporting `busy:41%` have to mean the same thing for the number to be worth
transmitting. A station that has been listening for less than an hour reports
what it has and does not scale it up.

### 10.6.1 A reading without a bearer is not a reading

**`link:` is required whenever `busy:`, `txtime:` or `hears:` appears**, and a
packet carrying any of them without it is discarded rather than guessed at.

This is not pedantry. A station in this format is not one radio on one channel:
the same phone may be on LoRa, Bluetooth, WiFi Direct, a LAN and the internet at
once, and those bearers have nothing in common. On LoRa occupancy is a legal
duty cycle measured in seconds of owed silence; on a LAN it is close to
meaningless; on Bluetooth what binds is scan windows rather than airtime. A
single number averaged across them is not a quantity at all, and `busy:41%`
from a gateway would be a statement no receiver could act on and every receiver
would graph.

`hears:` has the same defect for a better reason. Hearing `X1PZ4Q` over
Bluetooth means it is in the room; hearing it over LoRa means it is somewhere in
ten kilometres of countryside. Recorded identically, those two facts are worse
than either alone.

So a station reports **once per bearer** and says nothing it cannot mean:

| `link:` | The bearer |
|---|---|
| `lora` | LoRa on an ISM band |
| `ble` | Bluetooth Low Energy |
| `wifi` | 2.4 or 5 GHz WiFi, including WiFi Direct and WiFi Aware |
| `espnow` | ESP-NOW, the connectionless 2.4 GHz protocol of the ESP32 family |
| `halow` | 802.11ah, sub-GHz WiFi |
| `lan` | a wired or local network the station is attached to |
| `internet` | reached through a gateway, wherever that gateway is |
| `vhf` | VHF packet |
| `uhf` | UHF packet |
| `hf` | HF |
| `cb` | Citizens' Band |
| `pmr` | PMR446 and its regional equivalents |
| `satellite` | any satellite path |
| `other` | something not in this list, named in `m:` |

The list is the one section 31.1 and `spectrum.md` already work through; this
key only gives it a name on the wire.

**Section 31.1 becomes computable because of this.** It already says a station
is bound by the strictest bearer it transmits on, and with one undifferentiated
number nothing could tell which bearer that was. Per-bearer readings can. A
phone bridging LoRa and the internet publishes `link:lora busy:41%` and, if it
cares, `link:internet busy:2%` -- two true statements where a single average
would have been one false one.

### 10.6.2 Why `busy:` matters more than it looks

Section 31 asks every station to be disciplined about airtime and gives it
nothing to measure. `busy:` is that measurement, and it changes politeness from
a rule of thumb into a decision.

A duty cycle is a legal limit on **one** transmitter. It says nothing about
whether forty other stations are already using the channel, and a station
obeying its own 1 percent perfectly can still be the packet that collides with
a call for help. A shared channel is a shared resource and the only station
that can see the whole of it is the one listening to it.

So a station that hears `busy:` climbing should slow down what is discretionary
-- beacons, status posts, history replays -- before the channel stops working
for what is not. **`urg:` (section 13.5) decides what survives that decision**,
and this is the reading that tells a station when to start making it.

`txtime:` is the honest half of the same measurement. A station reporting
`busy:60%` while contributing `txtime:45%` of it has identified the problem, and
it is itself.

### 10.6.3 `hears:` is what makes a mesh diagnosable

`hears:` is one station's answer to "who can you actually reach right now",
directly, without a relay.

It pays for itself three ways. It says **why a mesh is broken** -- a
station nobody lists is a station nobody hears, which is a different fault from
one that is heard but never answers. It says **who to route through**, since a
carrier that lists the recipient is one hop from delivering. And it is the best
evidence there is for choosing `hold:` in a `t:mailbox` declaration (section
13.12): the right mailbox is a station that other people list as heard.

Three limits, stated because a topology map invites over-reading:

- **Directly heard only.** A callsign reached through a relay does not belong in
  `hears:`, or the list stops meaning anything.
- **Most relevant first**, so a truncated list still carries the useful half.
  What counts as relevant is the sender's judgement -- signal now, uptime,
  whether the station is powered and stationary -- because a passing phone that
  happens to be loud is not more useful than the solar relay on the hill, and no
  single criterion suits every station. Signal per callsign is deliberately not
  carried: it would need a compound value this format does not have.
- **It is a claim like any other.** A station may list callsigns it cannot hear,
  and nothing here detects that. What it buys an attacker is being chosen as a
  carrier, which is why `hears:` informs a choice and never compels one.

The truncation of section 10.6.4 is **per bearer**, not a property of the
list. The advert channel cuts `hears:` to what fits one advert; the same
observation pushed to an archiver (section 36) carries the full list, over
section 6.6 parts when a busy gateway hears more than one packet holds --
about twenty-five callsigns fit a packet, two hundred fit nine. `peers:`
stays the true total either way, so a cut list is always visibly cut.

### 10.6.4 `peers:` says how many were left out

```
t:observation f:X1A67X link:ble peers:12 hears:X1RD89,X32DVA,CT1ABC-9
```

69 bytes. `peers:` is how many stations the sender can reach directly; `hears:`
is the ones that fitted. **A busy street will not fit** -- about 29
six-character callsigns reach the 250-byte limit, and a shared bearer will
offer less than that.

Without the count, a truncated list is a lie by omission: a reader cannot tell
"these three are all there is" from "these three of forty". With it, a station
that is one of thirty knows to ask rather than assume, and a client can say
"3 of 12 shown" instead of drawing a map that is quietly wrong.

`peers:` counts what `hears:` would have listed in full, so the two always agree
when nothing was dropped, and `peers:` is never smaller than the list.

### 10.6.5 `mail:` says there is something to collect

```
t:observation f:X1A67X link:ble peers:12 mail:3 hears:X1RD89,X32DVA,CT1ABC-9
```

76 bytes. `mail:` is how many messages this station is holding **for other
people** (section 13.4) and would hand over if asked. It is omitted when there
is nothing, because a field that is almost always `0` is a field not worth
transmitting.

**This is what makes carrying mail cheap.** The alternative is what it replaces:
airing every carried message as its own repeating broadcast, so that a passer-by
might catch one. That spends the channel on messages most listeners have no use
for, and spends it again every time the copy is refreshed. A beacon is on the
air anyway. Saying "I have three" in six bytes lets a station that can actually
reach one of the recipients ask for them directly, and lets everybody else
ignore it.

So the sequence is: a station beacons `mail:3`; a neighbour that recognises a
recipient -- because it is one, or because its own `hears:` covers one -- opens
a session and takes custody; everybody else spends nothing. The count is a hint
for deciding whether a session is worth the battery, not a promise about what
the session will contain.

Hearing is also often **asymmetric** -- a handheld hears a hilltop repeater that
cannot hear it back. Two stations listing each other can reach each other; one
listing the other cannot, and a client drawing a map should show the difference.

### 10.7 Stations without a clock

| Station capability | Key | Example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| keeps wall-clock time | `ts` | `ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40` | UTC |
| no clock, no storage | `age` | `age:30` | seconds between observation and transmission |
| no clock, persistent storage | `epoch` | `epoch:7.4210` | boot epoch 7, 4210 seconds into that epoch |

The epoch form supports stations with no real-time clock. The station keeps a
counter in non-volatile storage, increments it once per boot, and reports it
with its seconds since boot. Two properties follow.

Ordering without a clock: between two packets from the same station, the higher
epoch is later, and within one epoch the higher uptime is later.

Anchoring: a receiver holding a clock records the wall-clock time at which it
first heard a given epoch, and can then date every packet of that epoch,
including packets delivered days later.

A station that subsequently obtains the time sends one packet carrying both
forms, anchoring that epoch for all receivers in range, and thereafter sends
`ts:` only.

---

### 10.8 Units of measure

**Every measurement carries its unit, immediately after the number and with no
space between them.**

```
alt:3048m    spd:48km/h    temp:14.2C    press:1013.2hPa    rain1:0.4mm
```

A person reads the value and the unit together, with no table to consult and
nothing to remember about which key means what.

The unit is **required**, not optional. A bare number is not a measurement, it
is a malformed value, and it is skipped like any other. This is the rule that
separates XPRS from APRS: APRS units are implicit and positional, so a receiver
that assumes the wrong one is never told it guessed. Here there is nothing to
guess.

A sender transmits in the unit it works in. A boat reports knots, an aircraft
reports feet and knots, a European car reports km/h, an American weather station
reports Fahrenheit and inches of mercury:

```

94, 113 and 120 bytes.

### 10.9 The permitted units

| Quantity | Units | Canonical |
|---|---|---|
| distance, altitude | `m`, `km`, `ft`, `mi`, `nmi` | `m` |
| speed | `m/s`, `km/h`, `mph`, `kt` | `m/s` |
| angle | `deg`, `degm` | `deg` |
| temperature | `C`, `F` | `C` |
| pressure | `hPa`, `inHg` | `hPa` |
| rainfall | `mm`, `in` | `mm` |
| duration | `s`, `min`, `h`, `day`, `week` | `s` |
| frequency | `Hz`, `kHz`, `MHz`, `GHz` | `Hz` |
| transmit power | `W`, `mW`, `kW`, `dBm` | `W` |
| irradiance | `W/m2` | `W/m2` |
| voltage | `V` | `V` |
| proportion | `%` | `%` |
| signal power | `dBm` | `dBm` |
| signal ratio | `dB` | `dB` |
| dose rate | `nSv/h`, `uSv/h`, `mSv/h` | `uSv/h` |
| dose | `uSv`, `mSv`, `Sv` | `uSv` |
| activity concentration | `Bq/m3`, `pCi/L` | `Bq/m3` |
| power density | `uW/m2`, `mW/m2`, `W/m2` | `W/m2` |
| electric field | `V/m`, `kV/m` | `V/m` |
| magnetic flux density | `nT`, `uT`, `mT`, `mG` | `uT` |

`deg` is degrees true and `degm` is degrees magnetic. The difference is not
cosmetic: magnetic declination exceeds 20 degrees in parts of the world and
changes with the year, so a bearing whose reference is assumed is a bearing that
is wrong by an amount nobody can recover. A station reports whichever its
instrument gives it and says which that was.

`mG` and `pCi/L` are in the radiation families for the same reason: cheap EMF
meters read milligauss and radon reports in some countries come in picocuries
per litre, and the station's job is to report what its instrument showed, not
to convert it. Conversion is the receiver's (1 mG = 0.1 uT; 1 pCi/L = 37
Bq/m3).

Each key accepts only the units of its own quantity. `temp:48km/h` is not a cold
day, it is a malformed value, and a receiver skips it rather than trying to make
sense of it.

**A receiver converts to the canonical unit before it compares, stores or plots
anything.** Two stations reporting `spd:6kt` and `spd:3.1m/s` are reporting the
same speed, and a receiver that sorts them by their digits has a bug.
Conversion is the receiver's job precisely because the sender should not have
to do it: a skipper who has to convert knots to metres per second before
transmitting will eventually get it wrong, and nobody will notice.

The unit set is closed. A sender may not invent one, because a unit no receiver
recognises makes the value unreadable rather than merely unfamiliar, and unlike
an unknown key it cannot simply be skipped without losing the reading.

Coordinates are the one exception: `pos:` carries no unit, because it is always
decimal degrees in WGS84 and no second option exists (section 10.1).

```

104 bytes.

### 11.5 Emergency

A call for help is its own packet type, not an observation with a flag on it
(section 15):

```
t:sos f:X1QZ3N pos:38.7223,-9.1393 acc:6m kind:medical ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:broken leg, cannot walk

t:pong f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 rssi:-92dBm snr:7.5dB
```

47 and 69 bytes. The reply reports the signal the test arrived with, which is
the receiver's measurement, not the sender's.

### 11.7 Reading a packet

```
t:observation f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7810,-9.2043 alt:210m temp:11.8C hum:88% press:1008.4hPa type:node ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40

| `pos:38.7810,-9.2043` | `coord` | 38.7810 N, 9.2043 W, four decimals, so about 11 m |
| `alt:210` | `dec` | 210 m above mean sea level |
| `temp:11.8` | `dec` | 11.8 degrees Celsius |

| `type:node` | `enum` | unattended node |
| `ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40` | `time` | UTC |

There is no `d:`, so it is addressed to no one in particular. There is no `q:`,
so nothing is expected back.

## 12. Worked exchanges

### 12.1 Group conversation with a reply and a reaction

```
1  t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:net starts in ten minutes
2  t:message f:X1RD89 d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:36:00 r:399227 m:I'll be late, start without me
3  t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:399227 add:like
```

78, 92 and 46 bytes. Packet 1 transmits no identifier; every receiver computes
`399227` from its sender, time and text. Packets 2 and 3 name that value.
Packet 2 has its own computed identifier and can be replied to in turn.

### 12.2 Direct message with both receipts

```
1  t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 q:ack,read m:did you get the keys?
2  t:receipt f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N r:9821a4 s:ack
3  t:receipt f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N r:9821a4 s:read
```

85, 42 and 43 bytes. Packet 1 asks for two things by name and packets 2 and 3
answer with the same names.

### 12.3 Request and partial answer

```
1  t:request f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 q:pos,batt
2  t:observation f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N pos:38.7810,-9.2043 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 s:pos
```

61 and 80 bytes. The station has no battery reading. It answers with what it
has and says which request that satisfied, so the asker is not left waiting.

### 12.4 A long group message

```
1  t:message f:X3RLY7 d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 n:1/3 m:The repeater on the hill is down.
2  t:message f:X3RLY7 d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 n:2/3 m:We swapped the antenna feed this morning
3  t:message f:X3RLY7 d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 n:3/3 m:and it is back up, but only just.
```

92, 99 and 92 bytes. Reassembly is keyed on `(X3RLY7, 2026-08-08_14:26:40)`.
Joined with one space between parts:

```
The repeater on the hill is down. We swapped the antenna feed this morning and it is back up, but only just.
```

If part 2 never arrives, the set is discarded after 10 minutes and nothing is
displayed.

### 12.5 Clockless weather station anchored by a neighbour

```
1  t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 temp:14.1C hum:80% epoch:7.3600
2  t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 temp:14.2C hum:78% epoch:7.4210
   A receiver holding a clock records: epoch 7 heard at 2026-08-08_14:26:40.

3  t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 epoch:7.9930 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
   The station has obtained the time and anchors epoch 7 for all receivers.

4  t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 temp:15.0C hum:74% ts:2026-08-08_14:36:00
```

54, 54, 65 and 67 bytes. Packets 1 and 2 are orderable without any clock, since
the higher uptime is later. Packet 3 makes the anchor explicit.

---

# Part IV. Delivery

One section, the longest in the document. A packet outruns its radio
by being repeated, or by being carried -- relays, custody, receipts,
mailboxes, and the scope rules that keep local traffic local.

## 13. Relaying and carried messages

A packet may travel further than the radio that sent it. A message to a station
no path reaches is handed to a nearby station, which carries it and delivers it
on meeting the recipient; a digipeater repeats what it hears so that stations
beyond the sender's range receive it.

`via:` is the list of callsigns that relayed the packet, in order, oldest
first. **A relay never rewrites `f:`.** It appends itself to `via:` and leaves
the author alone.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 q:ack m:meet at the bridge at six
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 via:X32DVA q:ack m:meet at the bridge at six
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 via:X32DVA,CT1ABC-9 q:ack m:meet at the bridge at six
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 via:X32DVA,CT1ABC-9,X3RLY7 q:ack m:meet at the bridge at six
```

84, 95, 104 and 111 bytes: as sent, then after each of three relays. The
recipient reads that the message came from `X1QZ3N` and travelled through
`X32DVA`, `CT1ABC-9` and `X3RLY7` in that order.

The hop count is not transmitted. It is the number of callsigns in `via:`, which
every station can count for itself, and a packet with no `via:` has taken no
hops.

The identifier is `de9780` in all four. Both the identifier and the signature
are computed with `via:` removed (sections 5 and 9.1), so relaying alters
neither, and a station that already holds the message recognises the repeat and
does not display it twice.

### 13.1 How far a packet travels

A relay forwards a packet only while `via:` holds fewer callsigns than the limit
for that packet type:

| Packet type | Relays |
|---|---|
| `sos`, `warning` | 9 |
| everything else | 3 |

The limit belongs to the type rather than to a field. A sender cannot ask the
network for more of its airtime than its traffic warrants, and an emergency does
not have to remember to ask: `sos` and `warning` travel nine relays because
they are the packets worth spending a shared channel on, and a chat message
travels three because it is not.

### 13.2 Loops

**A station that finds its own callsign in `via:` does not relay the packet**,
whatever the count says. The limit bounds how far a packet travels; the path
prevents it from travelling in a circle, and neither substitutes for the other.

A relay also drops a packet it has already relayed within the last few minutes,
identified by the identifier of section 5. Two digipeaters in range of each
other otherwise trade the same packet until the limit is reached, which is legal
under the rules above and still a waste of the channel.

### 13.2.1 When to re-air

The rules above say whether a packet may be relayed. They do not say **when**,
and on a shared bearer that is the difference between one transmission and five.

Every station in range hears the same packet at the same moment, and every one
of them that is willing to relay it is ready to transmit in the same instant.
On a LAN they collide as duplicates; on a radio they collide as radio.

So a station **waits a short random moment before re-airing**, and **drops its
copy if it hears the packet again during that wait**. Somebody else was closer
to the front of the queue; the packet is already travelling and a second copy
adds nothing but noise.

The wait is a fraction of a second on a fast bearer and longer on a slow one --
what matters is that it is random, so that two stations do not choose the same
instant, and that hearing the packet cancels it.

This works without a new field because a section 5 identifier is computed with
`sig:` and `via:` removed: the same packet relayed by a different station has
the same identifier. "Somebody already said this" is decidable from what is on
the air.

### 13.2.2 When the sender names the relays

Everything above decides who relays from what a station can see. `relay:` lets
the sender say it instead:

```
t:message f:X1VCVM d:X16JK8 ts:2026-08-28_09:40:00 relay:X3ARK,X3GSLC m:two hops
t:message f:X1VCVM d:X16JK8 ts:2026-08-28_09:40:00 relay:X3ARK,X3GSLC via:X3ARK m:two hops
t:message f:X1VCVM d:X16JK8 ts:2026-08-28_09:40:00 relay:X3ARK,X3GSLC via:X3ARK,X3GSLC m:two hops
```

80, 90 and 97 bytes: as sent, after the first named station, after the second.
The identifier is `ccd6ce` in all three.

**The next hop is the first callsign in `relay:` that does not appear in
`via:`.** Nothing consumes the list and nothing rewrites it; the two fields
together say what was asked for and what has happened so far, and the second is
what advances. Callsigns compare whole and case-insensitively (section 3.0.1),
suffix included -- `X3ARK-9` is a different device from `X3ARK` (section 3.1),
and a sender that writes one meaning the other has named a station that will
never answer.

**A station not named does not relay the packet.** That is the point: on a
shared bearer where everybody hears everybody, section 13.2.1 leaves exactly one
relay standing, and which one is a matter of whose random wait was shortest. A
sender that needs a particular second hop cannot get one by asking the network
more loudly.

**A station that is named may still decline.** Section 13.12.2 says it of
mailboxes and it is just as true here: *listing a station is not asking its
permission*. A named station relays under its own policy and its own airtime
budget (section 31), and one that carries nothing is still a good citizen.

**Three fields hold a list of callsigns and they are not the same field.**
`relay:` is the route asked for, and only the author writes it. `via:` is the
route taken, and every relay appends to it. `route:` (section 13.10) is the
route taken as the recipient attested it, inside a signature. Asked, happened,
attested.

`relay:` is covered by `sig:` and is inside the identifier of section 5, which
`via:` deliberately is not. So a relay cannot quietly rewrite where a packet was
asked to go, and **a station must never edit `relay:`** -- doing so changes the
packet's identity at every hop, and every mechanism that recognises a packet by
its identifier stops working at once. It also follows that **`via:` is not a
subset of `relay:`** and must never be validated as one: a carrier delivers, a
station may relay a packet naming nobody, and an older station relays without
reading the field at all.

**The section 13.1 budget still binds**, counted from `via:` exactly as before.
A `relay:` naming more stations than the type's budget allows names hops that
can never fire, and a sender composing one has made an error worth refusing at
the keyboard rather than discovering on the air.

**Section 13.2.1's cancel does not apply to a named hop.** Under this section at
most one station is willing to relay at any moment, so there is nothing for the
cancel to prevent; what it would do instead is let a station outside `relay:`
silence the one the sender asked for. The random wait still applies, because it
costs nothing and there is no reason for two mechanisms where one will do.

**Carrying is not relaying, and section 13.3 is not suspended.** A holder may
deliver a held packet to the station named in `d:`, appending itself to `via:`
as it always does -- that is the last hop and it is honest. It may not hand the
packet to another holder while `relay:` names hops that have not happened. Mail
that cannot move waits, which is what carrying is for.

**Naming stations is not naming bearers.** A named station relays on whatever
bearers it has, exactly as it would for any other packet. Section 36.0's rule
about choosing among paths to the same station is unchanged.

A station that does not know this field skips it (section 4) and relays under
section 13.2 as before, so `relay:` narrows the traffic only among stations that
understand it. It is a request, not a guarantee, and a sender that needs a
guarantee does not have one.

Two costs worth stating. The field is carried on every part of a split message
(section 6.6), and with the `via:` it accumulates a two-hop path adds about
thirty-six bytes to a packet that has two hundred and fifty -- a sender must
leave room for a `via:` it will never see. And `relay:` is in the clear beside a
sealed `x:` body: it says nothing about the message and something about who the
sender believes can carry it.

Section 13.9 records that each `via:` which arrives is a route that actually
worked. `relay:` is how a station acts on that knowledge next time.

### 13.3 Carried messages

A carrier holding a message for a station that is not currently reachable
follows the same rules: it appends itself to `via:` when it finally transmits.

The recipient's `s:ack` releases carriers still holding a copy. A station that
overhears a receipt for a message it is carrying discards its copy, which is why
a receipt is worth repeating even after the sender has seen it.

---

### 13.4 Carrying toward a place

A message addressed to someone no path reaches, and whom no carrier knows, can
still arrive if it says where it is going.

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 dest:37.98,23.73 near:50km until:2026-09-08_00:00:00 q:sign m:are you still in Athens in September?
```

150 bytes: Lisbon to Athens, 2852 km, with nothing in between.

| Key | Meaning here |
|---|---|
| `dest:` | where the packet is bound |
| `near:` | how close counts as arrived |
| `until:` | when it stops being worth carrying |
| `urg:` | how much it is worth carrying |
| `via:` | who has carried it, as everywhere else |

`near:` is a separate key from `rad:` and not a second meaning for it. `rad:`
always describes the area a subject occupies -- a fire, a flood, how far a
station will travel to deliver. `near:` always describes how close to `dest:` is
close enough. A warning about a fire being carried to a town needs both at once
and they are different numbers (section 13.8).

**A carrier accepts a copy only if it expects to reduce the distance to
`dest:`.** That is the whole routing rule. A station driving to Madrid is 483 km
closer to Athens and takes it; one sailing to the Azores is not and does not. A
carrier already in `via:` does not take it again, and a carrier inside `near:`
stops carrying and starts airing it normally, because it has arrived.

A packet with `dest:` is **not** bound by the three-relay limit of section 13.1.
Three relays do not cross a continent. It is bound by `until:` instead, which is
why `until:` is required here and optional everywhere else: a carried packet
with no expiry is litter that outlives the reason it was sent.

**`until:` is never more than one year after `ts:`.** A packet still being
carried a year later is not in transit, it is lost, and a network that cannot
say so accumulates the difference for ever.

There is no copy limit in the format. Each carrier decides what to hold, and
`store-and-forward.md` already bounds that with a per-device quota and eviction
by priority, so a limit here would duplicate one the carrier already enforces
and cannot be trusted to obey anyway.

### 13.5 Urgency

`urg:` takes one of `low`, `normal`, `high`, `urgent`. It is what a carrier
sorts by when its store is full and something has to be dropped.

It is a request, not an instruction. A carrier is free to ignore it, to carry
only `low` traffic for its own reasons, or to distrust a station that marks
everything `urgent` -- and stations will. `urg:` earns its byte because the
alternative is a carrier choosing by arrival order, which is worse for everyone.

An `sos` is not marked `urgent`; it is an `sos`, and section 13.1 already gives
it nine relays. `urg:` is for ordinary traffic that happens to matter.

### 13.6 What a carrier can read

A carried packet passes through strangers. The envelope is what they need and
the body is not:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 dest:38,24 near:200km urg:high until:2026-09-08_00:00:00 x:<64 characters> sig:<60 characters>
```

239 bytes. `dest:`, `near:`, `urg:` and `until:` stay in cleartext because a
carrier cannot route without them. `m:` is replaced by `x:`, sealed to the
recipient's key, so every carrier can decide whether to carry it and none can
read it. This is the same rule as section 9.2 and needs no new mechanism.

A sealed body is longer than the text it replaces, so a long carried message is
split into parts (section 6.6). Every part repeats the routing keys, since a
carrier may hold one part and not another.

**`dest:` tells every carrier roughly where your correspondent is**, and `d:`
already told them who. Coarsen it deliberately: `dest:38,24 near:200km` says
"somewhere around Athens" and is 2 decimal places short of a street. Section
10.1 ties decimal places to precision, and here that is a privacy control
rather than an accuracy claim.

### 13.7 Signed receipts

`q:sign` asks the recipient to sign an acknowledgement. It is a person agreeing
that they read something, not a device reporting that bytes arrived:

```
t:receipt f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-20_09:12:00 r:766d3e s:sign dest:38.72,-9.14 near:50km until:2026-10-01_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

184 bytes. `r:` names the original message -- `766d3e`, computed from its
sender, timestamp and text -- and `sig:` signs the receipt, which covers `f:`
and `r:` together (section 9.1). The result is evidence that the holder of
`X1RD89`'s key acknowledged that exact message, and it is checkable by anyone
holding the public key, not only by the sender.

The receipt carries its own `dest:` and `until:`, because it has to hitchhike
home the same way the message came.

| `s:` | Means | Signed |
|---|---|---|
| `ack` | it reached a device | **by default** (section 13.7.1) |
| `read` | it was opened | **by default** (section 13.7.1) |
| `sign` | a person acknowledged it | **required** |

**An `s:sign` receipt without a valid `sig:` is not a signed receipt.** A
receiver discards it rather than showing it as one: the state exists because of
the signature, and a state that can be claimed without proof is worth less than
no state at all.

A signed receipt can be replayed by anyone who heard it, and that is harmless:
it names one message and says one thing, so a second copy asserts exactly what
the first did.

### 13.7.1 Receipts without asking

A direct message between two stations that have exchanged one before is
acknowledged automatically. Neither operator turns anything on, and the sender
does not have to remember `q:ack`:

```
t:message f:X1RD89 d:X1A67X ts:2026-08-12_17:28:52 m:on my way
t:receipt f:X1A67X d:X1RD89 r:40f357 s:ack
```

62 and 42 bytes. `r:40f357` is the message's identifier (section 5), so the
receipt costs two thirds of what it confirms and names it exactly.

This exists because the alternative is a message that fails in silence. A
station that hands a packet to a radio and hears nothing back cannot tell
delivery from loss, so it cannot retry, and a lost message is simply gone while
both operators believe it arrived. Measured between two phones with no internet:
a reply left as a single unacknowledged transmission was recorded as delivered
and retried **zero** times.

**When it applies.** One condition: a direct message has already passed between
the two callsigns, in **either** direction. From then on each acknowledges the
other's direct messages. A relayed message is acknowledged the same way -- the
receipt travels home as section 13.7 describes, and a carried message is
precisely the case where the sender has least other evidence.

**When it does not.** Each of these would put an acknowledgement on a shared
channel for every station that hears it, so none of them is automatic:

| Not acknowledged | Why |
|---|---|
| a broadcast (no `d:`) | one packet, every hearer answering |
| a regional message (`dest:`, no `d:`) | same, bounded only by the region |
| a group message | every member answering every message |
| a receipt | an acknowledgement of an acknowledgement never terminates |
| a station never exchanged with | see below |

`q:ack` still works, and still asks a station outside these rules for a receipt.

**Why a known station rather than everybody.** An acknowledgement is airtime
paid on a channel everyone shares, and answering a stranger also confirms to
anyone listening that this callsign is here and awake. Two stations that have
already exchanged a direct message have both of those costs priced in; a
stranger has not agreed to either.

An automatic receipt carries no `q:` -- it is a device reporting bytes, not a
person agreeing to anything, and that remains `s:sign` (section 13.7), which is
still asked for explicitly. But it **is signed**, and this is the one place
where that is not a preference:

```
t:receipt f:X1A67X d:X1RD89 r:40f357 s:ack sig:<60 characters>
```

107 bytes, against 44 unsigned. The reason is what an unsigned one is worth to
an attacker. `s:ack` is not merely a note to the sender: section 7 has every
carrier holding that message **discard its copy** when it hears the matching
acknowledgement. So a forged receipt is not a lie about delivery -- it is a way
to delete a message from the whole mesh, cheaply, without holding anyone's key,
for any callsign the attacker cares to name. The victim is told their message
arrived, the carriers drop it, and nobody ever finds out.

**A receipt whose signature does not verify changes nothing.** It does not mark
a message delivered, it does not release a held copy, and it does not stop a
retry. A station that has never heard the signer's key cannot verify one, and
must treat it the same way: unverifiable is not "probably fine". Section 13.7
already says this of `s:sign` -- *a state that can be claimed without proof is
worth less than no state at all* -- and the same sentence was always true of
`s:ack`; it simply had not been written down.

On a rated bearer 107 bytes is two and a half times the airtime of 44. The
answer is to send **fewer** receipts -- section 13.7.2 already spends them only
against evidence the peer is there -- and never to send unsigned ones. An
acknowledgement nobody can check is airtime spent on nothing.

### 13.7.2 When to stop trying

A receipt that never comes is an instruction to stop, not to try harder.

The failure this guards against is the expensive one. A station holding an
unacknowledged message for a peer that walked out of range will re-air it on
whatever schedule it was given, and every one of those transmissions is spent on
a peer that is not there. On a duty-cycled band that is not merely wasteful:
section 31.1 counts a retry against the same budget as saying it the first time,
so a handful of stations each nursing a few undelivered messages can hold a
frequency down between them while delivering nothing.

**A retry is spent only against evidence that the peer can be reached.** Two
kinds count, and either will do:

| Evidence | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| the peer's beacon, heard recently | section 10.6 -- it already names the station and where to write to it |
| a live route to it | the bearer, on the paths that have one |

With neither, a station **parks** the message. Parking is not failure and not
delivery: nothing is transmitted, the copy stays held, and the attempt is not
counted. The station keeps listening, and when the peer's beacon returns the
ladder resumes where it left off rather than having been spent into an empty
room. A peer that comes back in an hour is then still owed its message, which is
what store-and-forward was for (section 13.3).

This costs nothing to implement, because the evidence is already arriving: a
station hears its neighbours' beacons whether or not it has anything to send.

**Three more rules keep the acknowledgement itself cheap.**

- **A receipt rides with traffic when it can.** A station that owes an
  acknowledgement and is about to send that peer something anyway names the
  message in `r:` on the packet it was already sending, rather than paying for a
  transmission of its own.
- **One cycle per peer, not one per message.** Several messages waiting for the
  same station are retried together.
- **The bearer sets the cadence, and the strictest one binds** (section 31.1).
  The fast first attempts that make a conversation in one room feel immediate
  belong to Bluetooth; on LoRa the same ladder is fewer rungs, further apart.

### 13.8 Delivering to a region

A message with `dest:` and **no `d:`** is addressed to whoever is in that region
rather than to a person. Carriers take it there and stations already there air
it locally.

```
t:message f:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 dest:38.72,-9.14 near:30km urg:high until:2026-08-15_00:00:00 m:water is off in the old town until Friday
```

147 bytes: get this to within 30 km of Lisbon, and it stops mattering on Friday.

Nothing new is needed for this. `d:` absent already meant "anyone in range"
(section 6.1); adding `dest:` and `near:` moves which range. The same rules
apply: a carrier takes it only if it gets closer, `until:` is required and is
never more than a year out, and `urg:` decides what survives a full store.

There is no recipient, so nothing is acknowledged. `q:sign` on a regional
message is meaningless and ignored.

Any packet type can be delivered this way, and for a warning the two circles are
genuinely different things:

```
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:39.40,-8.20 rad:5km dest:38.72,-9.14 near:40km urg:urgent kind:fire sev:danger until:2026-08-10_00:00:00 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

150 bytes: a fire five kilometres across at `pos:`, to be delivered within 40 km
of a town 80 km away. `pos:` and `rad:` describe the fire; `dest:` and `near:`
describe where people need to hear about it. Collapsing those into one key would
have made this packet unsayable.

### 13.9 The same message by two routes

Two copies that travelled differently are still one message:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 dest:37.98,23.73 near:50km until:2026-09-08_00:00:00 q:sign via:X32DVA,CT1ABC-9,SV1XYZ m:are you still in Athens in September?
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 dest:37.98,23.73 near:50km until:2026-09-08_00:00:00 q:sign via:X3RLY7,IT9ABC,SV2QRP m:are you still in Athens in September?
```

177 and 175 bytes. Both are identifier `766d3e`, because an identifier is
computed with `via:` removed (section 5) and that is the only field the two
copies differ in.

So the recipient recognises the second copy as one it already holds and shows it
once. This is not a rule that had to be added: it falls out of deriving
identifiers from the message rather than the journey.

It does **answer** each copy, with the same receipt. The two cases are
indistinguishable on the air -- a resend after a lost acknowledgement carries
the same identifier as the original, because the identifier describes the
message and not the attempt -- so a recipient that answered only the first copy
would leave a sender whose receipt was lost retrying against a silence it can
never break. A receipt is idempotent (section 13.7): re-airing it asserts
exactly what the first one did. Bound it at one receipt per message per sender
per 20 seconds, so a burst of copies is answered once rather than once each.

The difference between the copies is worth keeping rather than discarding. Each
`via:` is a route that actually worked, which is knowledge no single copy
carries: the recipient learns that both `SV1XYZ` and `SV2QRP` can reach it, and
a reply can be sent back along the one that arrived first.

### 13.10 Recording the route in the receipt

`via:` on a carried packet is appended to by each carrier, so on arrival it
names everyone who moved it. A signed receipt copies that list into `route:`
and signs it:

```
t:receipt f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-20_09:12:00 r:766d3e s:sign route:X32DVA,CT1ABC-9,SV1XYZ dest:38.72,-9.14 near:50km until:2026-10-01_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

213 bytes. `via:` on this packet is the receipt's own journey home, which is a
different list and is still being written. `route:` is the journey the message
made, fixed at the moment it arrived.

Because `sig:` covers everything except itself (section 9.1), the signature
binds the signer, the message identifier and the route together. The sender
gets back a statement that this person read this message and that it came by
these hands, which nobody along the way can alter without breaking the
signature.

A carrier that finds itself in a signed `route:` has evidence it delivered
something, which is the only durable record any of this produces.

---

### 13.11 How far a packet may go

`scope:` limits where a packet may be transmitted and repeated. It is optional
and **the default is global**: a packet without it may go anywhere, which is
what every packet in this document does.

| `scope:` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| absent, or `global` | anywhere, on any bearer |
| `local` | short-range bearers only: Bluetooth LE, WiFi Direct, WiFi Aware, and a local network |
| an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, uppercase | not relayed out of that country |

Lowercase words and uppercase codes cannot be confused, which is the same
convention callsigns and enums already follow everywhere else.

### 13.11.1 local

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 scope:local m:anyone got a 10 mm spanner?
```

92 bytes, twelve of them the field.

**`local` names bearers, not a distance.** A station must not put the packet on
a radio band, on a satellite, or onto the internet. It may put it on Bluetooth,
WiFi Direct, WiFi Aware or the network it is attached to.

That is the difference between "the people in this building" and "everyone who
can hear a 500 mW transmitter", and it is a privacy control as much as a noise
one: a question asked in a marina should not arrive in the next county, and it
certainly should not reach a relay that gates to the internet.

**LoRa sits on the boundary, and the operator places it.** A LoRa link can be a
building's own low-power mesh or a forty-kilometre shot across a valley, and no
rule written here can know which one a given antenna is. Whether a station
treats ITS LoRa as a local bearer is the operator's setting. The default is NOT
local: a sender marking a packet `local` is trusting every station within
earshot with the promise above, and the conservative reading is the only one a
stranger's promise can survive. An operator who knows their LoRa reaches the
campsite and nothing beyond may say so, and their station then carries `local`
packets on it.

**The approved room wires, end to end.** These three lines are the whole
chat interoperability story -- a phone application, a captive-portal web
page and a microcontroller's LCD all read and write exactly these, with no
translation layer anywhere:

```
t:message f:X16JK8 ts:2026-08-19_14:37:08 scope:local sig:<60 characters> m:hello from the Chat wapp, locally
t:message f:X9WEB ts:2026-08-19_14:58:01 m:round two global
t:message f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-19_15:02:10 scope:local root:399227 r:8536fb sig:<60 characters> m:replying inside the local room
```

The first is the local room: twelve bytes of `scope:` buy the whole privacy
behaviour, everything else is an ordinary message packet. The second is the
global room, which is simply the default. The third shows that threads
(section 6.4) compose with scope like any other field.

**Applications show the two scopes as two conversations.** The `scope:local`
traffic is the room of whoever is actually around -- the marina, the building,
the campsite -- and the unmarked default is the conversation that travels. A
chat that mixes them flattens exactly the distinction the field exists to
draw.

**A `local` packet is not carried.** Section 13.4 exists to deliver somewhere
else later, and somewhere else later is what `local` excludes. A carrier holding
one drops it rather than taking it to another town.

### 13.11.2 A country

```
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:39.4012,-8.2043 rad:5km kind:fire sev:danger scope:PT ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

99 bytes. A station **does not relay it out of the named country**, which it
decides from its own position -- the same position that already chose its
frequency (section 1 of [spectrum.md](spectrum.md)).

More than one country is a comma-separated list, which a border region needs:

```
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:41.8012,-6.7543 rad:9km kind:fire sev:danger scope:PT,ES ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

102 bytes: a fire nine kilometres across on the Portuguese side of a border, to
be relayed in both countries because the smoke does not stop either.

**Radio does not respect borders, and `scope:` cannot pretend otherwise.** A
transmission near a frontier is heard across it whatever this field says. What
`scope:` governs is what a station chooses to *relay*, to carry, and to gate
onto another network. Reception is not restricted and cannot be: a station that
hears an out-of-scope packet may read it, and simply does not pass it on.

A receiver that does not know where it is treats a country scope as global for
reading and refuses to relay, which is the safe direction: it sees the packet
and does not spread it.

### 13.11.3 Gateways

A gateway republishes a packet onto something that is not XPRS: an internet
relay, a NOSTR relay, APRS-IS, a web page, a chat room. That is not relaying,
the rules in section 13.1 do not reach it, and this is why it has to be
said separately.

**A gateway treats `scope:` as binding.** It never publishes a `local` packet at
all, and never publishes a country-scoped packet outside that country. A
gateway that cannot determine where it is does not publish country-scoped
traffic.

This is the leak that matters, because a gateway is the one station whose whole
purpose is to move traffic somewhere the sender cannot see.

Three things follow that a community should know before relying on any of it.

**The default publishes.** No `scope:` means global, and global includes the
internet. A group that does not want its traffic leaving must say so on every
packet; silence is not a restriction.

**A group is an address, not a boundary.** `d:LISBOA` says where a packet is
going, not who may read it. Anyone in range hears it, any station may relay it,
and a gateway may publish it. Group membership is not enforced anywhere in this
format and cannot be, because a broadcast medium has no door.

That holds for a closed group too (section 26). A member list decides what a
client **shows**, never what may be transmitted or received, so `d:X5A3F2` is as
public as `d:LISBOA` -- and publishes the roster on top.

**Only encryption keeps content private.** `scope:` asks well-behaved stations
not to spread a packet. It is a request that a hostile or careless station
ignores, and it leaves the text in clear for everyone in radio range regardless.
A packet that must not be read by strangers uses `x:` (section 9.2), and one
that must not travel uses both.

### 13.11.4 Against the other limits

`scope:` is an additional constraint and replaces nothing. A packet still stops
at the relay limit of section 13.1, still expires at `until:`, and still gets
carried only toward `dest:`. Whichever binds first, binds.

Where `scope:` and `dest:` disagree -- a country scope with a destination
outside it -- **`scope:` wins and the packet is not carried.** A sender that
meant it to travel should not have restricted it.

---

### 13.12 Where to leave mail for me

`t:mailbox` names the stations a sender should hand mail to when the recipient
cannot be reached directly.

```
t:mailbox f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 hold:X3RLY7,X32DVA sig:<60 characters>
```

125 bytes. `hold:` lists callsigns **in order of preference**, and a station
that cannot reach `X1QZ3N` tries `X3RLY7` first.

This is the missing half of section 13.4. Carrying toward a place works when the
sender knows where the recipient is; a mailbox works when the sender knows who
tends to see them. A boat that checks in at the same marina, a person whose
neighbour runs a solar node, a group whose members all pass one repeater: those
relationships exist and nothing in the format could infer them.

`until:` bounds the declaration, which matters because the arrangement changes:

```
t:mailbox f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 hold:X3RLY7,X32DVA,CT1ABC-9 until:2026-09-08_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

160 bytes. A mailbox list with no expiry outlives the friendship, and a sender
handing mail to a station that stopped carrying it a year ago gets silence.

**A mailbox declaration must be signed, and a receiver that cannot verify one
must not act on it.**

A declaration is CONSUMED, not only displayed: an archiver must be able to
answer "who holds for X1QZ3N" from the declarations it verified (the reverse
of the lookup it does for itself), because section 36.8.1 routes held mail by
exactly that answer, in `hold:`'s order of preference.

This is the one packet in the format where forgery pays directly. Anyone who can
publish `t:mailbox f:X1QZ3N hold:<attacker>` collects that station's incoming
mail from every polite sender, and the sender believes it delivered. Signing is
the default everywhere (section 9.1) and here it is the reason the rule exists:
an unsigned mailbox declaration is a request to misroute somebody's mail, and
it should be ignored rather than displayed.

### 13.12.1 Several at once, each for a period

**A station publishes as many mailboxes as it has, and they coexist.** An
earlier draft said the newest declaration replaced the previous one, which made
it impossible to say the true thing: that where you are found depends on when.

`since:` and `until:` bound each one. A boat that knows its season says so
months ahead:

```
t:mailbox f:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 hold:X3RLY7,X32DVA sig:<60 characters>
t:mailbox f:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 hold:CT1MAR since:2026-09-01_00:00:00 until:2026-09-30_23:59:59 sig:<60 characters>
t:mailbox f:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 hold:EA7CAN,EA7GIB since:2026-11-01_00:00:00 until:2027-03-31_23:59:59 sig:<60 characters>
```

125, 170 and 177 bytes. Home stations all year, a marina through September,
the Canaries from November to March. All three are true and none contradicts
another.

A declaration with no `since:` or `until:` is open-ended and always applies. One
with a window applies only inside it.

**Where windows overlap, the narrowest one that contains the moment wins.** In
September a sender uses `CT1MAR` rather than the open-ended pair, because a
declaration made about September is better information than one made about every
month. Within a single declaration, `hold:` stays in order of preference.

Outside every window a sender falls back to the open-ended declaration, and
failing that to any station advertising `serve:archive` (section 24.2).

### 13.12.2 Cancelling one

Plans change earlier than they were meant to. A declaration is withdrawn by
naming it, exactly as a warning is (section 17.2):

```
t:mailbox f:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-20_09:00:00 r:46b4ba remove:mailbox sig:<60 characters>
```

130 bytes. `r:46b4ba` is the identifier of the marina declaration and
`remove:mailbox` says what is being withdrawn. The other two are untouched,
which is why a cancellation names one instead of replacing all of them.

A cancellation must be signed like the declaration it cancels. An unsigned one
is a request to stop delivering somebody's mail, which is an attack rather than
an administrative act.

Re-publishing a declaration after cancelling it is allowed and produces a new
identifier, because `ts:` differs. There is no way to un-cancel, and none is
needed.

Listing a station is not asking its permission. `hold:` records where the sender
believes their mail will be seen, and a station named in one is free to carry
nothing: it is under exactly the quota and priority rules of
[store-and-forward.md](store-and-forward.md) as for any other traffic.

### 13.12.3 Asking whether there is mail

`q:mail` asks a station how much mail it holds. `only:` names whose, and its
absence asks about the total the station is carrying for everybody.

```
t:request f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 q:mail only:X1QZ3N
t:observation f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:41 s:mail mail:3 only:X1QZ3N
```

The answer is the `mail:` of section 10.6.5, narrowed: how many messages this
station holds for that callsign and would hand over if asked. Zero is answered
`mail:0` rather than with silence, because "nothing for you" and "did not hear
you" are different facts and a station coming back needs to tell them apart.

**This exists because the alternative is expensive.** Without it the only way
to learn whether a station holds anything is `cmd:history only:X kind:message`
(section 25.2), which replays the mail itself -- a page of packets, and a place
in the asker's hourly budget (section 31.2) -- to answer a question whose usual
answer is nothing. A station returning to a valley asks every archiver in
earshot before it asks one of them for contents.

The count is a hint and not a promise, exactly as the beacon's `mail:` is:
what a later `cmd:history` returns is bounded by the same eviction (section
36.11) and the same budget as everything else. Any asker may be answered --
knowing that mail exists is not reading it, and the mail itself is still
served only to its two parties.

---

# Part V. Position and safety

Movement, and the traffic that outranks everything else in this
document. An sos is a packet type, not a flag on one.

## 14. Tracks

A track is a named sequence of positions: a flight, a ride, a crossing. Any
station may record one and publish it as it goes, and a receiver assembles the
points into a line without having heard the beginning.

```
t:track f:X3BAL1 track:sagres-2026 seq:1 pos:38.9012,-9.0021 alt:11240m type:balloon ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
t:track f:X3BAL1 track:sagres-2026 seq:2 pos:38.9104,-8.9772 alt:14980m climb:4.8m/s type:balloon ts:2026-08-08_14:36:00
```

107 and 120 bytes. `track:` names the track and `seq:` places the point within
it.

- **`track:` is optional.** A track packet without one belongs to the station's
  current track, keyed on `f:` alone. A station that runs one track at a time
  never names it:

  ```
t:track f:X1QZ3N seq:7 pos:38.7301,-9.1355 spd:5.2m/s dir:41deg type:bike
ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 ```

  Naming becomes worth its bytes when a station runs more than one track, or
  when a track is worth referring to after it ends.
- When present, `track:` is a `label`: lowercase letters, digits and `-`, no
  spaces. It is chosen by the station and is unique only in combination with
  `f:`, so two stations may both run a track called `commute` without
  collision.
- `seq:` counts from 1 and increases by one per point. A receiver that sees
  `seq:1` then `seq:4` knows two points are missing and draws the gap rather
  than a straight line through it.
- A track point carries any observation field. Altitude, speed, course and
  vertical speed describe the movement; `ts:` dates it.
- A track is never complete. There is no final packet, because a station that
  stops transmitting is indistinguishable from one that is out of range.

```
t:track f:X1QZ3N track:commute seq:7 pos:38.7301,-9.1355 spd:5.2m/s dir:41deg type:bike ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

110 bytes.

A track packet is an observation with a name attached. It is a separate type
because a receiver files it differently: an `observation` replaces what it knew
station's position, and a `track` is appended to a line.

### 14.1 Updating a track

Later points are sent as further `track` packets carrying the same `track:` and
a higher `seq:`. A point sent again with a `seq:` already held replaces it,
which is how a station corrects a position it later computed more accurately.

### 14.2 What the station is riding on

`type:` names what is moving, from this set. It applies to `observation` and
`track` alike.

| Group | Values |
|---|---|
| On foot | `foot`, `run`, `ski`, `horse` |
| Cycles | `bike`, `ebike`, `motorcycle` |
| Road | `car`, `bus`, `truck`, `tractor`, `emergency` |
| Rail | `train`, `tram` |
| Water | `boat`, `sailboat`, `ship`, `kayak` |
| Air | `airplane`, `helicopter`, `glider`, `balloon`, `drone` |
| Fixed | `node`, `digi`, `wx`, `home`, `portable` |

The words are English and are not translated on the wire. A receiver displays
them in the operator's own language from this fixed set, which is the reason the
set is fixed: a value invented by one station cannot be translated by another.

A receiver that does not recognise a value displays a default marker and the
value as text.

---

## 15. Calls for help

`t:sos` is a call for help. It is a packet type rather than a flag on an
observation, so that a station can act on it after reading three bytes and
without understanding anything else in the packet.

```
t:sos f:X1QZ3N pos:38.7223,-9.1393 acc:6m kind:medical ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:broken leg, cannot walk
```

103 bytes.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `pos:` | yes, if known | where the person is |
| `acc:` | no | how well that position is known, metres |
| `kind:` | no | what is wrong |
| `ts:` | yes | when the call was made |
| `since:` | no | when the situation began |
| `m:` | no | anything a rescuer should know |

`kind:` takes one of `medical`, `trapped`, `lost`, `fire`, `water`, `cold`,
`assault`, `vehicle`, `other`.

Everything except `ts:` is optional, and a call with no position is still
transmitted. A person who cannot get a fix is the person who most needs
help, and a format that refuses to carry the call because a field is missing has
failed at the only moment that matters.

```
t:sos f:X1QZ3N pos:38.7223,-9.1393 kind:trapped ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

70 bytes: no accuracy, no message, and still actionable.

An `sos` is relayed up to nine times (section 13.1). It is never encrypted:
a call for help that only one station can read is worth less than one anybody
can. Any station may answer with `s:ack`, and more than one should.

---

## 16. Warnings

`t:warning` reports a hazard: a thing happening in a place, rather than a thing
happening to the sender. A station transmits a warning about a fire it can see;
it transmits an `sos` about a fire it is caught in.

```
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:39.4012,-8.2043 rad:5000m kind:fire sev:danger ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:fast moving, wind from the north
```

127 bytes.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pos:` | centre of the affected area |
| `rad:` | radius of the affected area, in metres |
| `kind:` | what the hazard is |
| `sev:` | how bad it is |
| `ts:` | when the warning was issued |
| `m:` | context a person needs and the fields cannot carry |

`kind:` takes one of `fire`, `flood`, `storm`, `wind`, `snow`, `ice`, `quake`,
`tsunami`, `landslide`, `chemical`, `radiation`, `outage`, `road`, `crowd`,
`animal`, `other`.

`sev:` takes one of the three below. A condition not serious enough for
`watch` is a notice rather than a warning (section 17).

| `sev:` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `watch` | may affect you, be ready |
| `warning` | will affect you, act now |
| `danger` | life-threatening, leave |

`pos:` with `rad:` states an area rather than a point, which is what a hazard
occupies. A receiver knows whether it is inside the circle without asking
anyone.

```
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 rad:1200m kind:flood sev:watch ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

92 bytes: a flood watch 1200 m around a point, with no message, because
the fields already say it.

A warning is relayed up to nine times and is never encrypted, for the same
reason an `sos` is not. `ts:` matters more here than anywhere else in this
document: a fire warning that arrives by carrier three days later, and is
plotted as current, is worse than no warning.

---

## 17. Notices

`t:info` reports something worth knowing that is not yet a hazard: a queue, a
stopped vehicle, standing water, fog on a bend. It is the same shape as a
warning and carries the same fields, and it is a separate type for two reasons.

A station filters on it after five bytes, without parsing a severity out of the
middle of the packet. A subscriber who wants hazards and not road conditions
gets that by type rather than by reading every packet and deciding.

And it does not inherit the relay budget of an emergency. `sos` and `warning`
travel nine relays because they are worth spending a shared channel on. A
traffic queue travels three, like ordinary traffic, because it is not.

```
t:info f:X1CAR7 pos:38.7231,-9.1402 rad:800m kind:traffic ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 until:2026-08-08_15:30:00
```

106 bytes: a queue 800 m around a point, expected to clear by half past.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pos:` | where it is |
| `rad:` | how far it extends, optional |
| `kind:` | what it is |
| `ts:` | when it was reported |
| `since:` | when it started, or will start, optional |
| `until:` | when it is expected to end, optional |
| `m:` | context the fields cannot carry |

`kind:` takes one of `traffic`, `stopped`, `slow`, `works`, `closure`, `rain`,
`snow`, `ice`, `fog`, `wind`, `debris`, `animal`, `crowd`, `event`, `other`.

There is no `sev:`. The type is the severity: an `info` is by definition not
urgent, and a `warning` grades itself from `watch` to `danger`. A notice that
turns out to matter is re-sent as a `warning`, which is a different packet
the same one edited.

```
t:info f:X1CAR7 pos:38.7231,-9.1402 kind:stopped ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:car on the hard shoulder, hazards on
t:info f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 rad:5km kind:rain ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:standing water in the underpass
```

110 and 110 bytes. `rad:` is optional: a stopped car is at a point, and
standing water covers a stretch of road.

```
t:info f:X1QZ3N pos:38.7301,-9.1355 kind:fog ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

67 bytes, which is the whole of it: fog, here, now.

### 17.1 When the condition starts and ends

Three times may appear on one packet and they answer three different questions.

| Key | Question |
|---|---|
| `ts:` | when was this packet written |
| `since:` | when did the condition start, or when will it start |
| `until:` | when is it expected to end |

`ts:` is a property of the packet. `since:` and `until:` are properties of the
thing the packet describes, and both are optional `time` values.

A condition rarely begins when someone gets around to reporting it. A fire has
been burning for hours before the first warning goes out, and reporting it at
`ts:` alone makes every receiver believe it started at that moment:

```
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:39.4012,-8.2043 rad:5km kind:fire sev:danger ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 since:2026-08-07_23:10:00
```

116 bytes: reported at 14:26, burning since 23:10 the previous night.

`since:` in the future describes something that has not happened yet, which is
how planned work is announced:

```
t:info f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7231,-9.1402 rad:2km kind:works ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 since:2026-08-15_07:00:00 until:2026-08-22_18:00:00
```

129 bytes: roadworks, announced on the 8th, starting on the 15th and
expected to finish on the 22nd. **A receiver does not show a condition as
current before its `since:`.** It is a plan until then, and a station that plots
it as a live hazard a week early is worse than one that never received it.

`since:` applies to any packet describing something with a duration, including a
call for help:

```
t:sos f:X1QZ3N pos:38.7223,-9.1393 kind:trapped ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 since:2026-08-08_11:40:00
```

96 bytes: trapped since 11:40, reported at 14:26. The difference between
those two is the first thing a rescuer wants to know.

A transient condition with no end is worse than no condition at all. A queue
reported at eight and still on the map at midnight teaches everyone to ignore
the map, and by then the packet has usually outlived the person who could
withdraw it. When `until:` is absent a receiver applies its own expiry, and this
document does not fix that interval: a fog bank and a road closure do not expire
on the same clock.

### 17.2 Withdrawing a notice or a warning

A condition that ends before its `until:` is withdrawn by naming the packet that
reported it:

```
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:39.4012,-8.2043 rad:5km kind:fire sev:danger ts:2026-08-08_02:10:00
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:39.5511,-8.1002 rad:2km kind:fire sev:watch ts:2026-08-08_09:40:00
t:warning f:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:9fd8ea remove:warning
```

90, 89 and 65 bytes. Two fires from one station, then the first one out.

`r:` carries the identifier of the packet being withdrawn and `remove:` says
what is being withdrawn. The identifier is computed, not transmitted
(section 5), so both ends already have it: the first fire is `9fd8ea` and the
second `aad744`, from the sender and the second they were reported.

This is why neither a warning nor a notice needs a name of its own. Naming the
kind would not do: a station that has reported two fires and withdraws `fire`
has said nothing a receiver can act on. Naming the packet is exact, and the
mechanism is the one replies, reactions and receipts already use.

`remove:` takes the type being withdrawn: `warning`, `info`, `event`, `offer`,
`need`, `channel`, `passage`, `blog`, `mailbox`, `service`, `place`, `vote`,
`like` or `repost` for a reaction. It is stated
even though `t:` repeats it, so that a receiver can filter withdrawals of any
type on one key, and so that a later revision can withdraw part of a packet
rather than all of it.

A withdrawal carries no `pos:`, no `kind:` and no `m:`. It says one thing.

---

# Part VI. Identity and publishing

A callsign proven in public, and the durable things published under
one -- posts, passages, events, offers and needs, channels.

## 18. Proving a callsign

Anyone can write `f:CT1ABC-9` on a packet. Three things already limit what that
buys an impostor, and each stops short of the same place.

A signature (section 9.1) proves the packet was written by the holder of a key.
It is optional, most traffic will not carry one, and a signed packet can be
replayed later by anyone who heard it.

An `X1`, `X2` or `X3` callsign is derived from its own public key (section
3), so a station cannot announce one it does not hold: the characters would not match,
at whatever length it announces. **This does not extend to a callsign issued by
a radio authority.** `CT1ABC-9` has no arithmetic relationship to any key, so
nothing in the format prevents a second station from claiming it.

None of them proves the holder is present now. `t:challenge` does.

### 18.1 Publishing a key

A station transmits `t:identity` (section 9.3) periodically, not only once,
because a receiver that has never heard the announcement cannot check a
signature or issue a challenge. Every 30 minutes is a reasonable interval on a
quiet channel; a station that changes its key announces immediately and does
not wait.

`q:identity` (section 7) asks for one directly rather than waiting for the next
period.

### 18.2 The exchange

The challenger generates a nonce of at least 16 random bytes, seals it to the
public key the claimed callsign has announced, and sends it:

```
t:challenge f:X32DVA d:CT1ABC-9 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 k:npub1x32dva7fu9j9uenmyva7ha6x9eqwymytv2847ccv4vxdmn45y50q7hq2mv x:<64 characters>
```

187 bytes. `k:` carries the challenger's own key so the answer can be sealed
back to it without a prior exchange. Where the responder already holds that
key, it is omitted:

```
t:challenge f:X32DVA d:CT1ABC-9 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 x:<64 characters>
```

121 bytes.

Only the holder of the private key can recover the nonce. The answer is sealed
to the challenger's key and names the challenge in `r:`:

```
t:response f:CT1ABC-9 d:X32DVA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:35a544 x:<64 characters>
```

129 bytes. A challenger that gets back the value it expects has learned that
the station it is talking to holds the private key for that callsign, right now.

**The whole exchange fits in single packets**, with room to spare on each. That
is worth stating because it is the property the design has to have: a challenge
that had to be split across parts could not be answered by a station that heard
only some of them, and the stations most worth challenging are the ones at the
edge of range.

The sizes above are not estimates. Sealing uses AES-256-CBC under a shared
secret from static-static ECDH, which is what makes `k:` sufficient and an
ephemeral key unnecessary:

| | Bytes |
|---|---|
| challenge plaintext, `xprs-chal ` and a 16-byte nonce | 26 |
| padded to the block size | 32 |
| with the initialisation vector | 48 |
| base64url, no padding | 64 characters |

The answer seals 16 bytes and lands on the same 64 characters, the padding
absorbing the difference. A public key is 63 characters. Every figure above
follows from those three.

### 18.3 What the answer contains

**The answer is never the decrypted nonce.** It is

```
sha256(nonce | challenger callsign | responder callsign | challenge identifier)
```

truncated to 16 bytes and sealed to the challenger.

This matters more than it looks. A station that decrypts whatever arrives and
returns the plaintext is a decryption oracle: an attacker who has intercepted a
private message can submit that ciphertext as a challenge and have the victim
decrypt it. Returning a hash instead means an attacker learns nothing it could
not have computed by already knowing the answer.

For the same reason a station **only answers a challenge whose recovered
plaintext begins with `xprs-chal`**. Ciphertext that does not decrypt to that
marker is not a challenge, whatever packet it arrived in, and is discarded
without a reply.

Binding the callsigns and the challenge identifier into the hash stops an answer
being relayed as the answer to a different challenge, or to the same challenge
put by somebody else.

### 18.4 Rules

- A challenge and its answer are **never relayed**. Both are direct, and a
  station that receives one addressed elsewhere ignores it. Liveness proved
  through a relay is not liveness.
- An answer arriving more than 60 seconds after the challenge is refused. The
  point of the exchange is freshness.
- A station answers a limited number of challenges per period and ignores the
  rest. A challenge costs the responder a decryption, and an unlimited right to
  demand one from a battery-powered station is a way to flatten it.
- A challenge is never sent on amateur bands, since it cannot work without
  encryption (section 9.4).

### 18.5 What a failed challenge means

**No answer is not proof of forgery.** A station may be out of range, asleep,
rate-limiting, running on a radio that cannot encrypt, or simply not
implementing this section. Treating silence as guilt would make the network
hostile to the small stations it exists for.

A wrong answer is different, and is the one case that carries weight: something
claiming that callsign does not hold its key.

| Outcome | What it establishes |
|---|---|
| correct answer | the station holds the key, and held it a moment ago |
| wrong answer | it does not hold the key |
| no answer | nothing |

A receiver may show that a callsign has been proved recently. It should not show
that one has failed, unless it failed by answering wrongly.

---

## 19. Blog posts

`t:blog` publishes a piece of writing rather than sending a message. The
difference is not the length. A message is addressed to someone and expects to
be read once; a post is published, kept, listed and read later by people who
were not listening when it went out.

```
t:blog f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 title:antenna-notes tag:radio m:The wire ends are the whole job. Everything else is decoration.
```

134 bytes. `d:` is absent, so it is published to anyone in range; a post to a
group carries `d:` like any other packet.

### 19.1 Title

`title:` is a `label`: lowercase letters, digits and `-`, no spaces. It names
the post so that it can be listed, filtered and revised, and it is unique only
in combination with `f:`, so two stations may both publish `antenna-notes`.

A later post from the same station with the same `title:` and a newer `ts:`
**replaces** the earlier one. That is how a post is corrected. A message cannot
be edited and a post can, which is the second real difference between them.

`title:` is a slug rather than a sentence because no value except `m:` may
contain a space. The human title is the first line of the text, where a reader
expects it.

### 19.2 How long a post can be

A post is split across up to 9 parts like any other text (section 6.6), so its
length follows from the packet limit and what the envelope costs:

| Post | Bytes per part | Whole post |
|---|---|---|
| untitled, broadcast | 203 | **1827 characters** |
| titled | 183 | **1647 characters** |
| titled, one tag | 173 | 1557 characters |
| titled, signed | 183, less 63 on the last part | 1584 characters |

**About 1650 characters for a normal titled post**, which is three or four
paragraphs. That is a short essay, not an article.

```
t:blog f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 title:antenna-notes n:1/3 m:I rebuilt the dipole this weekend and measured it properly for once.
t:blog f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 title:antenna-notes n:2/3 m:The feed point was three centimetres off centre, which cost about a decibel.
```

135 and 143 bytes, parts 1 and 2 of 3.

### 19.3 Files and images

`file:` attaches one file to a post, content-addressed like any other
(section 6.7):

```
t:blog f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 title:antenna-notes file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg m:The finished dipole, feed point centred at last.
```

162 bytes, of which 52 are the file reference and 43 of those the digest
itself. The post reads on its own and the image is fetched by whoever wants it
and can.

About 1500 characters is a generous budget once a title, a few tags and an image
reference are paid for, and it is the same 9 parts every other kind of text
gets. The limit is not raised for posts. A post split across forty packets would
be unreadable until every one of them arrived, and on a channel where a single
advertisement is already a lottery that is a poor way to publish. A post that
genuinely needs more room is a document, and a document is a file.

### 19.4 Signing

A post should be signed. A message is usually one of many between two stations
that know each other, but a post is read later, by strangers, after being
relayed by stations the author never met, and authorship is the only thing a
reader has to go on. A signature costs 65 bytes on the last part.

---

## 20. Passages

`t:passage` says where a vessel is going and when it expects to arrive. It is a
float plan: filed before leaving so that somebody knows when to start worrying.

```
t:passage f:X1BOA3 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 dest:38.5241,-8.8931 since:2026-08-09_06:00:00 until:2026-08-09_18:00:00 onboard:3 type:sailboat ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

158 bytes.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pos:` | where it is departing from |
| `dest:` | where it is bound |
| `since:` | when it leaves, or left |
| `until:` | when it expects to arrive |
| `onboard:` | how many people are aboard |
| `type:` | what kind of vessel |
| `m:` | anything else worth knowing |

`since:` and `until:` are the ordinary keys (section 17.1) and are not renamed
for this packet: a passage is a thing with a start and an end like any other.
`until:` is the estimated arrival, and being an estimate is what makes it
useful. A vessel that has not arrived and has not cancelled by then is a vessel
worth asking about.

```
t:passage f:X1BOA3 dest:38.5241,-8.8931 until:2026-08-09_18:00:00 onboard:3 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

98 bytes: bound there, back by six, three aboard. That is the whole of a float
plan, and it fits in a third of a packet.

A passage is closed by sending another with the same `dest:` and a `since:` in
the past, or is superseded by any later passage from the same station. Arriving
and saying nothing is the case the format cannot fix, and no format can.

`onboard:` is a count and carries no unit, like `seq:` and `n:`. It is the
number a rescue coordinator asks for first.

---

## 21. Events

`t:event` announces something happening at a time and a place: a net, a market,
a meeting, a working party.

```
t:event f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 title:tuesday-net kind:net since:2026-08-11_20:00:00 until:2026-08-11_21:00:00 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:weekly net, all welcome
```

164 bytes.

`title:` names it, as it names a post, so an event can be revised: a later
`event` from the same station with the same `title:` replaces the earlier one,
which is how a time changes or a meeting is cancelled.

`kind:` takes one of `net`, `meeting`, `market`, `class`, `work`, `social`,
`race`, `service`, `other`.

`since:` and `until:` are when it starts and ends. `pos:` is where, and `rad:`
may give the area it covers when a point would mislead.

An event is a separate type from a notice because a receiver files it
differently. A notice is a condition that is true now and expires; an event is
an appointment, and belongs in a calendar rather than on a map.

---

## 22. Offers and needs

`t:offer` says what a station has. `t:need` says what it wants. They carry the
same fields and differ only in direction.

```
t:need f:X1BOA3 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 kind:crew rad:50km ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:two for a delivery to Madeira, leaving Friday
t:offer f:X1QZ3N pos:38.6902,-9.4012 kind:crew until:2026-08-20_12:00:00 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:deckhand, some night watch experience
```

125 and 135 bytes.

`kind:` takes one of `crew`, `transport`, `water`, `food`, `fuel`, `power`,
`shelter`, `berth`, `mooring`, `gear`, `room`, `tools`, `repair`, `medical`,
`childcare`, `internet`, `storage`, `labour`, `other`.

`crew` is in that list because it is the most common thing asked for and offered
where boats gather, in both directions: `t:need kind:crew` is a skipper short of
hands for a passage, and `t:offer kind:crew` is somebody willing to sail. The
same pair of types covers a village after a storm and a marina in October
without needing separate vocabularies.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind:` | what is offered or wanted |
| `pos:` | where |
| `rad:` | how far the sender can travel or deliver |
| `since:` | when it becomes available or needed |
| `until:` | when the offer or need lapses |
| `price:` | what is asked or offered, if any (section 22.1) |
| `m:` | the detail no vocabulary can carry |

```
t:need f:X1QZ3N pos:38.7223,-9.1393 kind:water rad:2km ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

77 bytes, which is all a request for water needs to be.

`until:` matters here as much as on a notice. An offer of a spare battery that
was taken three weeks ago and never withdrawn is worse than no offer, because
somebody will travel for it. A station that cannot say when its offer lapses
should re-send it rather than let a receiver guess.

Neither type is relayed further than ordinary traffic (section 13.1). A need is
not an emergency; a need that is an emergency is an `sos`.

---

### 22.1 Price

`price:` states what is being asked. It is optional: an offer without one has
simply not named a price.

```
price:120EUR          once, for the thing itself
price:25EUR/day       per day
price:150EUR/week     per week
price:12.50EUR/h      per hour
price:free            nothing
```

An amount, a currency, and optionally `/` and a period. No period means a single
price for the whole thing; a period means it repeats, which is the difference
between selling and renting.

Periods: `h`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`.

### 22.2 Currencies

The currency is an **ISO 4217 code**: three uppercase letters, from the official
list and never invented.

```
EUR  USD  GBP  CHF  JPY  CAD  AUD  NZD  SEK  NOK  DKK  PLN  CZK
BRL  MXN  ARS  ZAR  INR  CNY  IDR  PHP  THB  TRY  MAD  XOF  XPF
```

Those are examples, not the list. Any code in ISO 4217 is valid, and nothing
outside it is: a receiver that meets `price:120XYZ` skips the field rather than
displaying a number in a currency it cannot name.

No symbols. `EUR` and not the euro sign, because the format is ASCII, and `USD`
rather than a dollar sign, because a dollar sign is the currency of about twenty
different countries and says which one only by context a packet does not carry.

The amount follows the ordinary number rules (section 4.4): a decimal point and
never a comma, so `price:12.50EUR`, and no thousands separator, so
`price:12000EUR`.

### 22.3 When the price is not fixed

Not every price is a figure, and a seller who has not decided is common enough
to deserve saying rather than leaving the field out.

| `price:` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `120EUR` | firm, this is the price |
| `~120EUR` | negotiable, about that |
| `~25EUR/day` | negotiable, and per day |
| `offers` | no figure, make one |
| `swap` | wants a trade, not money |
| `free` | nothing |

A leading `~` means the figure is a starting point rather than a demand:

```
t:offer f:X1QZ3N pos:38.6902,-9.4012 kind:gear price:~120EUR ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:Aries windvane, needs a new bearing
```

121 bytes, one more than the firm version. It reads as "about 120 euros" to a
person and parses as an amount with a negotiable flag to everything else, which
is what a sorted list of prices needs.

`offers` says the seller wants to hear a number first:

```
t:offer f:X1QZ3N pos:38.6902,-9.4012 kind:gear price:offers until:2026-08-20_12:00:00 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:folding bike, working order
```

138 bytes. There is nothing to sort by, and a receiver showing it in a price
column shows the word rather than inventing a zero.

`swap` says money is not what is wanted:

```
t:offer f:X1BOA3 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 kind:gear price:swap ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:spare anchor for a good dinghy pump
```

118 bytes.

Leaving `price:` out entirely still means what it always meant: the sender has
not said. That is different from `offers`, which is an invitation, and from
`free`, which is a price.

`price:` works on a `need` as well, where it is what the sender will pay:

```
t:need f:X1BOA3 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 kind:berth price:30EUR/day since:2026-08-15_00:00:00 until:2026-08-22_00:00:00 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

137 bytes: wanted, a berth for a week in the middle of the month, at up to 30
a day.

```
t:offer f:X1QZ3N pos:38.7223,-9.1393 kind:crew price:free ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

80 bytes. `price:free` says so explicitly, which is worth doing when the
alternative is a receiver wondering whether the price was left out by accident.

### 22.4 The format carries no money

`price:` says what something costs and that is the end of this format's
involvement. **There are no payment packets, no balances, no receipts for money
and no tipping**, and the omission is deliberate rather than pending.

A packet saying a payment happened is worth exactly what the recipient's
willingness to believe it is worth, and it is the highest-value forgery in any
format that has one. Settlement needs a ledger somebody agrees on, and a lossy
broadcast medium where every station hears a different subset of the traffic is
close to the worst place to keep one.

Where value does move in this project it moves in the coin layer, which is a
different system with different guarantees. A `t:offer` says the berth costs
twenty-five euros a day; how the twenty-five euros travel is not a radio
question.

---

## 23. Channels

`t:channel` announces a frequency a station uses: what it is, how it is
modulated, whether the station transmits there, and when it is listening.

```
t:channel f:X1QZ3N freq:145.500MHz mode:fm kind:listen since:2026-08-08_18:00:00 until:2026-08-08_22:00:00 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

129 bytes: monitoring two metres this evening, receive only.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `freq:` | the frequency to tune to hear this station |
| `ch:` | its number in a band plan, where it has one |
| `mode:` | how it is modulated |
| `bw:` | bandwidth, where the mode does not imply it |
| `shift:` | repeater input, as an offset from `freq:` |
| `input:` | repeater input, stated outright (section 23.4) |
| `tone:` | access tone |
| `power:` | transmit power |
| `range:` | how far the operator expects it to reach |
| `kind:` | what the channel is for |
| `pos:` | where the station or repeater is |
| `site:` | whether it stays there |
| `supply:` | what powers it |
| `every:`, `for:`, `at:` | a recurring listening window (section 23.2) |
| `since:`, `until:` | when the whole schedule starts and stops |
| `m:` | anything else |

`kind:` takes one of `listen`, `simplex`, `repeater`, `beacon`, `net`,
`gateway`, `emergency`, `other`.

`mode:` takes one of `fm`, `am`, `usb`, `lsb`, `cw`, `ssb`, `packet`, `aprs`,
`lora`, `ft8`, `psk31`, `rtty`, `dmr`, `dstar`, `c4fm`, `m17`, `dv`, `other`.

### 23.1 Listening, or transmitting

**`power:` present means the station transmits on that channel. Absent means it
only listens.** There is no separate flag, because a transmit power is the thing
a listener would have had to state anyway, and a station that will not say its
power has not told you it transmits.

```
t:channel f:X1QZ3N freq:145.500MHz mode:fm power:25W kind:simplex ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

88 bytes.

`since:` and `until:` are the listening window, and mean what they mean
everywhere else (section 17.1). Their absence says the station listens whenever
it is on, not that it never listens.

A recurring schedule is not expressed here. A weekly net is a `t:event`
(section 21) that names the frequency, and this packet describes the channel
itself rather than the calendar around it.

### 23.2 Recurring windows

Three keys describe a schedule that repeats.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `every:` | how long between windows |
| `for:` | how long each window lasts |
| `at:` | the time of day the cycle is anchored to, UTC |

The 3-3-3 plan is channel 3, for 3 minutes, every 3 hours:

```
t:channel f:X1QZ3N freq:446.03125MHz ch:3 mode:fm every:3h for:3min kind:listen ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

102 bytes.

`at:` defaults to `00:00:00`, so `every:3h` alone means 00:00, 03:00, 06:00 and
so on in UTC, which is what makes the plan work: every station calculates the
same windows without anyone coordinating. A schedule anchored to local time
would put two neighbours an hour apart on different minutes.

Give `at:` when the cycle is not anchored to midnight:

```
t:channel f:CT1ABC freq:14.300MHz mode:usb every:1day at:20:00:00 for:1h power:100W kind:net ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

115 bytes: every day at eight in the evening, for an hour.

`since:` and `until:` bound the schedule itself, and are a different thing from
the windows inside it: `since:` says when the arrangement begins, `until:` when
it lapses. A net that runs weekly through the summer has both.

Absent `every:`, there is no schedule. `since:` and `until:` alone are a single
window, and neither means the station is deaf the rest of the time.

### 23.3 Where the station is, and whether it stays

```
t:channel f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7810,-9.2043 freq:145.600MHz mode:fm shift:-600kHz tone:123.0Hz power:50W range:40km site:fixed supply:solar kind:repeater ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

171 bytes: a solar repeater on a hill, reaching about 40 km.

`site:` takes one of `fixed`, `mobile`, `portable`, `temporary`. It answers a
question `type:` does not: whether the channel will still be there tomorrow.
A repeater is `fixed`, a handheld carried up a hill is `portable`, a vessel is
`mobile`, and a set installed for a weekend is `temporary`.

`supply:` takes one of `grid`, `solar`, `wind`, `hydro`, `battery`, `generator`,
`fuel`, `mixed`. It is what tells a reader whether a station survives a power
cut, which is the moment its frequency matters most. A `solar` repeater is
reachable after the grid drops and a `grid` one is not.

`range:` is the operator's own estimate of usable range, as a radius from
`pos:`.

**It is an estimate and the document says so.** Terrain, weather and the other
station's antenna decide what actually happens, and a hill between two stations
30 km apart beats a `range:40km` every time. It is published because the person
who installed the antenna knows better than anyone else what it usually does,
and a reader 200 km away can rule the channel out without trying.

```
t:channel f:X1BOA3 pos:38.6902,-9.4012 freq:156.800MHz ch:16 mode:fm power:25W range:15km site:mobile supply:battery kind:emergency ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

154 bytes: a vessel on channel 16, battery powered, about 15 km on a good day.

### 23.4 Repeaters that listen elsewhere

`freq:` is **the frequency to tune to hear this station**. On a simplex or
listen-only channel that is the whole story. A repeater has a second frequency:
the one it listens on, which is the one a user transmits on.

`shift:` gives it as an offset, which is how repeaters are conventionally
listed and is shorter:

```
shift:-600kHz     the input is 600 kHz below the output
```

`input:` gives it outright, for when it is not a simple offset:

```
t:channel f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7810,-9.2043 freq:145.750MHz input:433.000MHz mode:fm tone:123.0Hz power:25W range:30km kind:repeater ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

150 bytes: listens on 70 centimetres, transmits on 2 metres. No offset can
express that, because the two frequencies are not in the same band and the
number would be larger than either.

The two forms describe the same thing and a packet carries one, not both:

```
t:channel f:X3RLY7 freq:145.600MHz input:145.000MHz mode:fm kind:repeater ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

96 bytes, which is `shift:-600kHz` written out. Where a station sends both
anyway, `input:` is authoritative, being the measurement rather than the
arithmetic.

If the input differs by more than its frequency -- a different mode, a different
bandwidth, a gateway that hears DMR and speaks FM -- it is not one channel with
two frequencies. Send two `t:channel` packets with `kind:gateway`, one for each
side, and let each carry its own `mode:` and `bw:`. Cramming a second mode into
this packet would mean a second `mode:` key, and a key appears once.

### 23.5 One channel per packet

A station that uses several frequencies sends several packets, one each.

This is not a limitation worked around. A key appears at most once in a packet,
so two frequencies would need either `freq1:` and `freq2:`, or one value packing
frequency, mode and power together in a fixed order. The second is how APRS
encodes almost everything and the reason a receiver there cannot skip a field it
does not understand.

One packet each also means a station adding a band re-sends one packet rather
than all of them, a receiver can filter on `mode:lora` without parsing the
others, and a repeater's entry stays correct when the operator's handheld
changes.

```
t:channel f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7810,-9.2043 freq:145.600MHz mode:fm shift:-600kHz tone:123.0Hz power:50W kind:repeater ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
t:channel f:X3RLY7 freq:433.775MHz mode:lora bw:125kHz power:22dBm kind:gateway ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

136 and 102 bytes: a two-metre repeater with its offset and access tone, and a
LoRa gateway whose power is quoted in dBm because that is how the module is
specified.

```
t:channel f:CT1ABC freq:14.300MHz mode:usb power:100W kind:net since:2026-08-11_20:00:00 until:2026-08-11_21:00:00 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:maritime mobile net
t:channel f:X3RLY7 freq:156.800MHz mode:fm kind:emergency ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:channel 16, monitored continuously
```

159 and 117 bytes.

### 23.6 Transmitting is regulated

A `t:channel` packet says what a station does; it does not make it lawful. A
frequency, a power and a mode together describe a transmission that in most of
the world requires a licence, an allocation, or both, and neither this document
nor a receiver can tell whether the sender holds one. Announcing a channel is
not a claim of authority to use it, and section 9.4 continues to govern what may
be transmitted where.

### 23.7 Meeting on a working channel

Radio settled this long ago: everyone monitors a calling channel, and a pair
with real business moves off it. A file transfer at calling-channel rates is
minutes of a jammed commons; the move costs one packet there and puts the
minutes somewhere private. This section is that move, in vocabulary the
document already has.

**A `t:channel` with `d:` is an invitation**: this channel, for you, now.
Every field keeps its section 23 meaning -- the keys say where, `until:` says
how long the inviter will wait there, `q:ack` asks for the answer, and `r:`
names the exchange the move serves, usually the `cmd:file` or `cmd:put` that
made a working channel worth having.

```
192  t:channel f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 freq:433.900MHz mode:lora bw:250kHz until:2026-08-17_16:20:00 q:ack r:b47210 ts:2026-08-17_16:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

When the meeting place is a technology rather than a frequency, `link:`
(section 10.6.1's bearer word) names it and `ch:` carries whatever label that
technology needs -- a WiFi channel number, a network name:

```
164  t:channel f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 link:espnow ch:6 until:2026-08-17_16:10:00 q:ack ts:2026-08-17_16:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

The invitee answers the ordinary way -- `s:ack` is "moving now", `s:no` is
"cannot", with the reason where reasons go:

```
107  t:receipt f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N r:72fe2f s:ack sig:<60 characters>
127  t:receipt f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N r:d8b7be s:no sig:<60 characters> m:no espnow hardware
```

**The choreography, step by step -- because a device listens ONE frequency at a
time**, and a step out of order strands somebody on a channel nobody else is
tuned to. Implementations follow this sequence and expect it of each other:

1. **Invite, on the calling channel.** The inviter keeps listening there -- it
   has promised nothing yet and moves nowhere until somebody accepts.
2. **Accept, on the calling channel.** The acceptance is the commitment. A
   `s:no`, or silence until the invitation's freshness runs out, ends the
   matter with everyone still on the commons.
3. **Move.** On HEARING the acceptance the inviter tunes to the working
   channel and listens; on SENDING it the invitee tunes and follows. From
   this moment both are deaf to the calling channel -- which the rest of the
   network handles as ordinary absence: anything addressed to them waits in
   custody or a mailbox like mail for any station that is away (section 13.3).
4. **"I am also here -- start sending."** The invitee re-airs its acceptance
   ON the working channel: the same signed packet, the same identifier, and
   hearing it there is the proof it cannot fake from anywhere else -- the
   party is tuned, present, and ready. The station with the bulk to transmit
   sends nothing until it hears this. The same packet serves twice: the
   first airing commits, the second locates.
5. **Work, then give the channel back.** The exchange runs (section 25.2.2's
   middle block); when it ends -- or `until:` passes, whichever is first --
   everyone returns to the calling channel. A transfer the working channel
   killed mid-way is resumed later with `off:` (section 25.2) on whatever
   lane the pair next shares; the commons is not the place to debug it.
6. **Nobody came.** An inviter alone on the working channel at `until:`
   returns to the commons and treats the acceptance as overtaken by events --
   no error packet, because the party that failed to arrive is not listening
   anywhere useful to send one.

**More than two parties** works the same way, because every step is already
per-station: the invitation goes to a group (`d:` takes a group name), each
member accepts or declines individually on the commons, and the transmitting
station starts when the parties it heard arrive -- step 4, once per accepting
station -- or when `until:` forces its hand. Whoever accepted but never
arrived catches up like any absent station: `cmd:history`, a mailbox, the
next snapshot.

Rules, all inherited:

- **The working channel is borrowed, never claimed.** Both stations return to
  the calling channel when the exchange ends or `until:` passes, whichever is
  first. A pair that stops answering on the commons has not moved, it has
  vanished, and section 31 already says what a vanished station owes nobody.
- **One channel per invitation** (section 23.5). Offering a fallback is a
  second invitation, and the answer says which was taken by which `r:` it
  names.
- **An unsigned invitation is not followed.** "Meet me elsewhere" is the
  cheapest lure there is -- it parks the recipient on an empty frequency and
  takes them off the shared one -- which puts it in the same class as the
  unsigned mailbox declaration of section 13.12: ignored, not displayed.
- **Moving is transmitting.** Section 23.6 and 9.4 govern the working channel
  as they governed the calling one; an invitee without the licence or
  the hardware answers `s:no` and the pair uses what they share.

This is also the missing handshake of section 25.2.2: when a pair's best bulk
lane is not obvious from the bearers they are already on, the invitation is
how one proposes and the other agrees -- and the transfer's control packets
then bracket a lane both actually chose.

---

# Part VII. Stations and automation

Stations that do things for other stations. Announced services, signed
commands and their results, operated devices, owned stations, and
closed groups with signed membership.

## 24. Services

`t:service` says what a station does for other stations.

```
t:service f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7810,-9.2043 serve:relay,archive ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 sig:<60 characters>
```

146 bytes: a node that repeats packets and carries mail.

`serve:` is a comma-separated list from a fixed set:

| Word | The station |
|---|---|
| `relay` | repeats packets it hears |
| `archive` | an archiver (section 36): keeps a spool of what it hears and re-airs it on `cmd:history`, archives its depositors' publications and answers queries, holds mail for stations that named it (or for anyone, as it pleases), and publishes its directory of who-keeps-what (section 36.9). One word covers all of it -- there is no separate service for the pointer half or the storage half, and the offer is the same on every bearer the station has (section 36.0) |
| `super` | a super-archiver (section 36.9.4): the archive role at server scale -- gossip for every callsign it can learn of, budgets orders of magnitude above the reference numbers. Announced beside `archive`, never instead of it |
| `internet` | gateways to the internet |
| `aprs` | gateways to APRS-IS |
| `nostr` | runs a NOSTR relay |
| `files` | hosts content-addressed files: answers `q:have` (section 7.1) and `cmd:file`, and accepts `cmd:put` deposits within its budgets (section 25.2) |
| `devices` | operates automated devices, each an `X4` station of its own (section 25.7.1) |
| `time` | has a clock worth trusting, usually from GNSS |
| `weather` | publishes observations |
| `wifi` | offers network access to people nearby |
| `other` | something not in this list, described in `m:` |

### 24.0.1 `count:` on an archiver's announcement

An archiver states how much it is holding:

```
117  t:service f:X3P7QK serve:archive count:1234 fw:1.4.2 sig:<60 characters>
```

**`count:` is the number of RECORDS the archive holds, not the number of
callsigns it has heard from.** The distinction is the whole value of the field.

A listener uses `count:` to decide whether asking is worth it. Section 36.10.1's
pocket device cannot afford a `cmd:history` per period on the chance that
something arrived -- a replay is metered (section 31.2), and one spent to be
told "nothing changed" is one not available when something did. So it remembers
the last `count:` it saw from each archiver and asks only when the number moves.

Counting callsigns breaks that, and breaks it silently. An archiver that has
heard from six stations for a month reports `count:6` however much those six
say, so a listener watching it sees a number that never changes and concludes
there is nothing to fetch -- while the archive fills up behind it. The failure
looks like a working poller, which is the worst kind.

A record count is not required to be exact, and an archiver that evicts under
section 36.11 will see it fall. What is required is that it MOVES when the
archive takes something new, because that movement is the signal. An archiver
that cannot cheaply produce one omits `count:` rather than publishing a
constant: a listener that sees no `count:` falls back to asking on a period,
which is slower but honest, and one that sees a frozen number does not.

**A listener must not treat `count:` as knowledge that survives.** It is a
reading, and readings go stale -- particularly across a change of bearer, where
the announcement carrying it may not travel. Stale knowledge is worse than none
because it looks like knowledge, so `count:` may only ever bring an ask
FORWARD; it may never be the reason one is skipped indefinitely. Section
36.10.1's period remains the backstop whatever `count:` says or fails to say.

(`count:` also appears on `t:file kind:folder`, where it is the number of files
in a listing, section 6.7.3. The packet type says which is meant.)

A station with a position and a power source says so, because both decide
whether it is worth routing through:

```
t:service f:X3RLY7 pos:38.7810,-9.2043 serve:relay,archive,internet,aprs supply:solar ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 sig:<60 characters>
```

173 bytes. `supply:solar` from section 23.3 means it survives a power cut,
which is when a gateway matters most.

### 24.1 What this is not

**Physical goods and help are `t:offer`, not this.** Water, fuel, shelter, a
lift, a spare battery and a berth are already in section 22 with a price and an
expiry, and they belong to a person rather than a station. `t:service` is what a
radio does on the network, and the division is worth keeping: a station offering
`internet` is advertising a route for packets, and one offering `wifi` is
advertising a socket for humans.

### 24.2 The other half of a mailbox

`serve:archive` is a station volunteering to hold mail. `t:mailbox` (section
13.12) is a recipient nominating. They are opposite directions of the same
arrangement and neither implies the other.

A sender with mail for an unreachable station looks for a `t:mailbox` from that
station first, because the recipient knows best who sees them. Failing that, any
station advertising `serve:archive` is a reasonable guess. **Neither is a
promise.** A carrier is under the quota and eviction rules of
[store-and-forward.md](store-and-forward.md) whatever it advertised, and a
station that stops carrying does not owe anybody a withdrawal.

### 24.3 Trust

**Sign it.** Signing is the default (section 9.1) and an unsigned service
advertisement is worth nothing: `serve:internet` is an invitation to route
traffic through a station, and forging one is the cheapest way to collect other
people's packets.

Even signed, an advertisement is a **claim about capability, not a promise of
behaviour, and never evidence of good faith**. A station that truthfully
gateways to the internet may also log everything that passes. Encrypt what
should not be read (section 9.2) and set `scope:` on what should not travel
(section 13.11); neither depends on trusting the station that carries it.

### 24.4 One port on an IP network

**A station reachable over TCP listens on port 4242, and that one port speaks
both Reticulum and XPRS.** 4242 is already the port Reticulum hubs answer on,
so an operator opening a firewall for one has opened it for both, and a client
guessing the port guesses right.

The two are told apart by the first byte of the connection, and nothing else:

- A Reticulum stream is HDLC-framed, and every frame begins with the flag
  byte `0x7E`.
- An XPRS connection is printable text, and a packet begins with `t:`
  (section 4) -- the first byte is `0x74`.

A listener reads one byte and knows which protocol it has. A stock Reticulum
client connecting to the port works untouched; an XPRS client sends packets as
lines of text, one packet per line, and receives the same. Everything on such
a connection is an ordinary packet -- a `t:ping` is answered with a `t:pong`, a
`cmd:history` with the replay of section 25.2 -- so the socket adds no new
vocabulary, only a wire.

Two rules keep the demultiplexing honest, and they are load-bearing:

- **XPRS on this port stays plain text, one packet per line.** No binary
  framing, no envelope. The packet already has a size limit (250 bytes) and a
  grammar (section 4); a line needs nothing more.
- **Nothing that is not HDLC may ever begin with `0x7E`** on this port. A
  future binary variant that starts with the flag byte breaks the one-byte
  decision, so there will not be one.

The bearer is decided by where the peer actually is, because a TCP socket does
not say. A connection from a private or link-local address is the LAN it looks
like: recorded under `lan`, visible on the air view, archived like any local
bearer. A connection from a public address travelled the internet whatever
port it used, and it is treated like the Reticulum lane: never shown
as an air sighting, and archived only under the mailbox-declaration rule of
section 36.3.

**The same number carries the broadcast bearer, on UDP.** TCP needs an address,
and the first station on a network knows nobody's. So `link:lan` (section 10.6)
is UDP 4242, broadcast, one packet per datagram, verbatim and with no header of
its own -- a station joins by opening a socket and is found without being looked
for. A packet is at most 250 bytes, so it always fits one datagram and is never
fragmented; a datagram that does not parse as a packet is dropped.

UDP 4242 and TCP 4242 are different sockets and never collide. Reticulum's own
LAN discovery is a separate protocol on a separate port and is not this.

Broadcast is heard by everyone at once, so relaying on it obeys section 13.2.1
without exception: a station that did not compose the packet waits 200-1200 ms,
and drops its copy if it hears the same section 5 identifier meanwhile. Its own
packets go out immediately, with no `via:`.

`until:` bounds the claim, and it should be short. A service list is a statement
about equipment that is switched on, and equipment gets switched off.

---

## 25. Commands

`t:command` asks another station to *do* something. `t:result` says what
happened.

```
t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:door-open arg:north sig:<60 characters>
```

139 bytes. `cmd:` is a `label` naming the action and `arg:` carries its
arguments, comma-separated. What the words mean is agreed between the two
stations and is not this document's business.

This is not `t:request`. That asks for state from a closed vocabulary -- send me
your position, send me your battery -- and reports. A command acts, its
vocabulary is whatever the operator defines, and reporting a battery level is
not the same act as unlocking a door.

### 25.1 The reply, immediately and again later

**A station answers a command at once, even when it cannot finish it.**

```
t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:747ae8 code:202 sig:<60 characters>
t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:29:12 r:747ae8 code:200 sig:<60 characters>
```

132 bytes each: accepted at 14:26:40, done at 14:29:12. `code:202` says the
command arrived and is being worked on; `code:200` says it finished. A sender
that hears nothing knows the command did not arrive, which is what makes
answering before the work is done.

**Any number of results may name one command**, and a late one needs no new
mechanism: `r:747ae8` is the command's derived identifier (section 5), and it is
the same however many minutes pass.

| `code:` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | done |
| `202` | accepted, working on it |
| `206` | part of the answer, more on request (section 25.2.1) |
| `400` | understood, arguments wrong |
| `403` | refused, not permitted |
| `404` | unknown command, or nothing held to answer it |
| `408` | too old, outside its freshness window |
| `429` | over budget, ask later or ask elsewhere (section 31) |
| `500` | tried and failed |

```
t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:747ae8 code:403 sig:<60 characters> m:not on the allow list
```

156 bytes. `m:` is detail for a person reading a log.

Numbers sit oddly beside `sev:danger` and `kind:fire`, and are still right here.
The outcome space is open-ended in a way a word list is not, and these
particular numbers are understood by everyone who has ever written a web
client.

### 25.2 The commands this document defines

What a command word means is agreed between two stations and is mostly not this
document's business. Two are the exception, because they cannot work between
strangers if every station names them differently.

**`cmd:history` asks a station to re-air what it kept.** It is how somebody back
from four days at sea catches up on a townhall that was aired once while they
were away.

```
153  t:command f:X1BOA3 d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:history since:2026-08-04_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
165  t:command f:X1BOA3 d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:history since:2026-08-04_00:00:00 only:X5A3F2 sig:<60 characters>
```

`since:` and `until:` bound the window and already mean exactly this everywhere
else. `only:` narrows the replay to one callsign or one group, which on a slow
bearer is the difference between a useful answer and an unusable one.

`kind:` narrows it to the packet types it names -- one, or a comma-separated
list -- each named by the `t:` value it matches:

```
166  t:command f:X1BOA3 d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:history since:2026-08-04_00:00:00 kind:message sig:<60 characters>
```

**`only:` and `kind:` are different questions and neither substitutes for the
other.** `only:` asks whose traffic; `kind:` asks what kind. An archiver keeps
everything it hears, and on a channel where presence beacons outnumber
conversation -- which is every channel -- a page of the newest twelve packets
is twelve beacons. Without `kind:` the asker has no way to say it wanted the
talking. An implementation that answers `only:` by matching a TYPE name has
merged the two, and then `only:X5A3F2` matches nothing while `only:message`
appears to work: the bug looks like a feature until the day somebody asks the
question `only:` is actually for. Absent, `kind:` matches every type.

**A standard command carries its parameters in the keys the format already
has**, not in `arg:`. `arg:` is positional, and design rule 1 says there are no
positional fields; it stays for operator commands, where this document has no
key to offer.

**`cmd:update` asks a station to install a firmware version.** It is the
third that cannot work between strangers if every station names it
differently, and it is specified in section 25.8 because what it costs --
a station that reboots into code somebody else chose -- deserves its own
rules rather than a line in a table.

**`cmd:file` asks for the bytes behind a `file:` reference.**

```
177  t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:file file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg sig:<60 characters>
186  t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:file file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg off:64kB sig:<60 characters>
```

Until now a `file:` reference could be shown and not resolved, which made every
photograph in the format decoration. The command says **what** is wanted and
never how it should travel; a station advertising `serve:files` (section 24)
answers, and which bearer carries the bytes is the transport's business and not
this document's.

`off:` resumes: send from that byte offset, because the first attempt died at
64 kB and the 64 kB that arrived are verified against the piece list (6.7.2)
or simply kept. A station that cannot resume ignores `off:` and sends from
zero -- the requester receives some bytes twice, and the file still
verifies or still fails as a whole.

The reply flow gives `cmd:file`'s codes their concrete meaning. `202` -- I hold
it and it fits my budget; the bytes then move on whatever bulk lane the pair's
bearers offer (a GATT session beside the advert channel, a Reticulum resource,
a fetch across the LAN -- examples, not requirements), and `200` follows only
after the REQUESTER's own hash check passed, making the final receipt a
statement about content rather than about transmission. `500` -- the transfer
started and died. `404` -- not held. `403` -- refused, and a file too large for
the station's budget is refused here with `m:` saying so, which is what
`size:` on the description exists to prevent. `429` -- over budget this hour,
with alternates in `m:` when the station knows any (section 31.2).

**`cmd:put` is the same exchange in reverse: I hold these bytes, take them.**

```
211  t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:put file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg size:2MB until:2026-09-08_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
132  t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:29:02 r:3148dd code:200 sig:<60 characters>
```

The ask names the file and its cost up front -- `size:` is mandatory here,
because accepting bytes unseen is how a small station is filled by a stranger
-- and `until:` bounds the stay, the discipline of section 36.7: a deposit is a
hold, not an archive. `202` means bring it, and the bytes travel as a
`cmd:file` answer does, in the other direction. The receiver verifies what
arrived against `file:` and answers the signed `200` above: **a custody
receipt for bytes**, section 13.7's receipt discipline applied to a file. A
station already holding the file answers `200` immediately -- the bytes exist,
custody is real, and nothing needs to travel; a sender must treat that as
success, not as an error. `403` and `429` refuse as they always do.

Why deposit at all: the recipient is away, and the file's author will be too.
A photograph left with the mailbox station a `t:mailbox` (section 13.12)
names, or with any station advertising `serve:files`, is a file that arrives
next week without either party being awake at the same time -- store and
forward for content, under the same quota rules as everything else a station
carries.

### 25.2.1 What comes back

The answer is the ordinary sequence of section 25.1 -- accepted, then done:

```
132  t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:41 r:747ae8 code:202 sig:<60 characters>
132  t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:31:02 r:747ae8 code:200 sig:<60 characters>
```

Between them the station re-airs the packets themselves. `code:404` says nothing
was held for that window, `code:403` that the station will not serve this
requester, and `code:429` that it is over budget -- with, by section 31, the
names of stations that might serve instead.

**The replay is the original packets, unchanged.** `f:`, `ts:` and `sig:` are
exactly as first transmitted, so authorship survives having been held for days
by a station nobody trusts. It cannot alter what it replays without breaking a
signature, and it cannot invent traffic that was never sent.

**A station answers with as much as it can afford, and says there is more.**
A week of a busy group will not fit in one exchange on a bearer that owes
several seconds of silence per packet, and a station must not have to choose
between sending everything and sending nothing.

```
132  t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:31:02 r:747ae8 code:206 sig:<60 characters>
```

`code:206` closes a page rather than the request: what came before it is a
complete, verifiable part of the answer, and more exists. `code:200` in the same
place means that was all of it.

**A page is continued by asking again for a narrower window**, not by a cursor:

```
179  t:command f:X1BOA3 d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:33:10 cmd:history since:2026-08-04_00:00:00 until:2026-08-06_11:02:44 sig:<60 characters>
```

**A replay runs newest first**, so the requester always knows where the page
stopped: it moves `until:` to the `ts:` of the oldest packet it received and
asks again. Newest first is also the right order for a person -- somebody back
from four days at sea wants last night before last Tuesday, and a page that
never arrives costs them the least.

Nothing here is stateful. The station keeps no cursor, remembers no session and
owes the requester nothing between exchanges, so a request that is never
continued costs it nothing, and a station that reboots mid-backfill has broken
no promise. Repeating a boundary packet is free for the same reason everything
else here is: duplicates collapse on their identifiers.

**Derived identifiers make backfill safe by construction**, and this is the part
worth understanding before implementing any of it. A replayed packet has the
same identifier it always had (section 5), so a client that already holds it
recognises the duplicate and keeps one copy. That single property removes the
machinery every comparable protocol needs: no cursors to persist, no sequence
numbers to allocate, no agreement about where one station's history ends and
another's begins, and no bug at the boundary between two windows. Asking two
stations for overlapping windows costs airtime and nothing else.

A station that keeps a spool says so with `serve:archive` (section 24). What it
keeps, for how long and for whom is its own to decide and to change: section
31.3 says why this document sets no retention period, and section 31.2 what a
station owes a stranger regardless.

### 25.2.2 A file transfer, on the wire

Illustrative, not normative: the packets below are this document's, the binary
frames between them belong to the bearer (here BLE's session protocol,
`docs/mesh.md`) and are shown ONCE so the division of labour is visible --
XPRS asks and receipts, the bulk lane moves bytes, and neither does the
other's job. X1QZ3N deposits a 240 kB photograph with X1RD89:

```
-- advert channel (XPRS) -----------------------------------------------
X1QZ3N-> t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-17_12:00:00 cmd:put file:nYxKzGm4vT2pQ8dW5jR7cL0aFbNs9hUe3oXiC6EkM1w.jpg size:240kB sig:<60 characters>
X1RD89-> t:result f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-17_12:00:03 r:a91f04 code:202 sig:<60 characters>

-- bulk lane (binary, one ATT write per frame; 4D 01 = the session magic) --
X1QZ3N-> 4D 01 20  FILE_OFFER   xfer=7, sha256 (32 bytes), size=240640,
                               ttl, origin "X1QZ3N", target "X1RD89",
                               ext "jpg", name "photo.jpg"
X1RD89-> 4D 01 21  FILE_ACCEPT  xfer=7, offset=0, window=16
X1QZ3N-> 4D 01 23  CHUNK        xfer=7, offset=0,   498 raw file bytes
X1QZ3N-> 4D 01 23  CHUNK        xfer=7, offset=498, 498 raw file bytes
        ...16 chunks per credit window...
X1RD89-> 4D 01 24  WIN_ACK      xfer=7, next=7968, window=16
        ...until offset reaches 240640...
X1QZ3N-> 4D 01 25  FILE_DONE
X1RD89-> 4D 01 26  FILE_OK      (receiver's own sha256 matched file:)

-- advert channel again ------------------------------------------------
X1RD89-> t:result f:X1RD89 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-17_12:02:31 r:a91f04 code:200 sig:<60 characters>
```

The portion of the file on the air is the CHUNK frame: a 3-byte envelope, the
transfer id, the byte offset, then **raw file bytes, unencoded** -- the packet
grammar never touches them. A lost chunk costs one window, because the
receiver's WIN_ACK names the next contiguous offset it wants and the sender
rewinds to it. The final signed `code:200` is the only durable record: a
custody receipt naming the command, issued only after the receiver hashed
what it holds. `accept` at `offset == size` is how "I already have it" is
said without moving a byte.

The same two XPRS packets bracket the transfer whatever the bearer -- a
Reticulum resource, a LAN fetch, a swarm -- with only the middle block
changing, which is why it stays out of this document. When the
lane is not obvious from where the pair already is, one of them proposes it
with a working-channel invitation (section 23.7) and the other agrees or
declines before a byte moves.

### 25.3 Keeping it out of the conversation

Four rules, each closing a specific confusion.

`t:command` and `t:result` are **distinct packet types**, so a station filters
them on the first field without parsing anything else.

**Neither is ever rendered as a message.** A command is not chat, and it must
not appear in a conversation view even when it carries `m:`.

**Neither is replied to or reacted to** (section 6.5). They are protocol
machinery like a receipt or a challenge.

**`m:` is detail, never the command.** A bot reads `cmd:` and `arg:`; the free
text is for the operator afterwards. A station that parsed instructions out of
`m:` would have built a natural-language interface to its front door.

### 25.4 Security

A packet that opens a door is the highest-value forgery in this format, and the
rules here are stricter than elsewhere because of it.

**A command must be signed, and one that cannot be verified is discarded.**
Signing is the default everywhere (section 9.1); here it is a requirement, and
"unsigned" is not a state a command may be acted on in.

**A command expires.** Without that, one signed packet opens a door for ever to
anyone who recorded it. The default window is **300 seconds** from `ts:`, and
`until:` extends it deliberately. Outside the window the answer is `code:408`.

Five minutes rather than the sixty seconds section 18.4 gives a challenge,
because a challenge is a direct exchange between two stations and a command
crosses real bearers: LoRa at SF9 owes 5.5 seconds of silence for every packet
under a 10 percent duty cycle, and a relay hop or two on top can honestly take
longer than a minute. Five minutes is still far too short for a recording to be
useful hours later.

**Commands are never carried.** Section 13.4 exists to deliver somewhere else
later, and later is precisely what a command must not be. A carrier drops one
rather than parking it.

**Repeating a command does not repeat the action.** The derived identifier of a
retransmitted command is unchanged, so a station that has acted on
`747ae8` recognises the second copy and answers again without opening the
door twice. Idempotency falls out of section 5 rather than needing a rule.

**Authentication is not authorisation, and this format only provides the
first.** A signature proves which callsign sent a command. Whether that
callsign may open that door is an allow-list held by the station acting on it.
Section 25.9 is how the owner puts that list on the wire; checking it is still
the station's alone, and nothing in XPRS checks one for it. A bot that acts on
any correctly signed command has an open door with extra steps.

Where bystanders should not learn what is being operated, seal it:

```
t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 x:<64 characters> sig:<60 characters>
```

182 bytes, sealed and signed. `t:`, `f:`, `d:` and `ts:` stay in clear so the
packet can be routed and its freshness checked without reading it.

### 25.5 Commands too long for one packet

A command splits across parts exactly as a message does (section 6.6), which
matters for the case that motivates it: a spoken instruction, transcribed, and
handed to a station that interprets it.

`cmd:interpret` says the text in `m:` is the instruction and is to be read
rather than matched:

```
t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:interpret n:1/3 m:open the north door for thirty seconds then switch the yard light on
t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:interpret n:2/3 m:and leave it until sunrise, and if the water tank is below a quarter
t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:interpret n:3/3 sig:<60 characters> m:start the pump for ten minutes and tell me what the level was
```

141, 141 and 199 bytes. Reassembled it is 266 bytes, which is why it split.

This is the one command whose payload is `m:`, and it is an **explicit opt-in**
rather than a hole in section 25.3. Everywhere else a bot reads `cmd:` and
`arg:` and never takes instructions from free text. A station that does not
interpret natural language answers `404`, and one that does has said so by
accepting this command word.

The reply names the **whole** command:

```
t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:863d7f code:202 sig:<60 characters>
```

132 bytes. `r:863d7f` is the identifier of the reassembled packet, not of any
part. Each part has an identifier of its own and none of them is the command's.

Three rules on top of section 6.6, all of them about not acting too early.

**A station acts only on a complete, verified set.** The signature is on the
last part and covers the reassembled packet, so a partial set proves nothing
about who sent it. Half a command is not a smaller command.

**Parts are held for the command's freshness window, not the ten minutes a
message gets.** A set still incomplete at 300 seconds is discarded, because a
command that has expired is not worth assembling.

**The window runs from `ts:`, which every part shares.** A three-part command is
one command that took a few seconds to arrive, not three events.

### 25.6 Interpretation is not authorisation either

`cmd:interpret` puts attacker-influenced text in front of a language model, and
that is worth stating plainly rather than discovering later.

A signature proves which callsign sent the text. It says nothing about whether
the text is a good idea, and a model asked to interpret "open the north door"
will do exactly as well with a sentence designed to talk it into something else.
The allow-list of section 25.4 matters more here than anywhere in this document,
because it is the only thing standing between a stranger and the interpreter.

**A model's output should not be the last check before a physical action.** Map
what it produces onto the same fixed set of commands a `cmd:` would have named,
and apply the same permission test. An interpreter that can emit any action at
all has made the allow-list decorative.

### 25.7 Devices: a shared vocabulary for acting on things

A command word is agreed between two stations (section 25), and between two
stations that is enough: `cmd:door-open` works because both ends chose it.
It stops working the moment the devices belong to strangers -- a lamp cannot
be operated by a visiting phone that has never heard the lamp-owner's word
for "on". The home-automation industry spent a decade arriving at this
lesson, and its answer (Matter is the current name for it) is not a wire
format worth importing but a vocabulary worth compressing: devices
interoperate when the words for acting on them are few, fixed and shared.
This section is that vocabulary in XPRS grammar.

**`cmd:set` asks a device to make a state true**, and carries its parameters
in the keys of this document, never in `arg:` (the rule of section 25.2):

```
132  t:command f:X1A67X d:X1LAMP ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00 cmd:set state:on sig:<60 characters>
142  t:command f:X1A67X d:X1LAMP ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00 cmd:set state:on level:40% sig:<60 characters>
136  t:command f:X1A67X d:X1DOOR ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00 cmd:set state:locked sig:<60 characters>
134  t:command f:X1A67X d:X1HEAT ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00 cmd:set target:21C sig:<60 characters>
```

Three keys carry the whole model:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | `enum` | the device's principal condition, from the closed list below |
| `level` | `qty`, proportion | how far, when a condition is partial: a dimmer, a valve, a volume |
| `target` | `qty` | the setpoint a device holds a reading at, in the reading's own unit |

`state:` takes a word from a **closed list this document owns**:

| Word | Device class | May be commanded |
|---|---|---|
| `on`, `off` | switch, light, pump, relay | yes |
| `open`, `closed` | contact, valve, gate, cover | yes |
| `locked`, `unlocked` | lock | yes |
| `motion`, `clear` | occupancy sensor | no, report only |
| `pressed` | button, doorbell | no, report only |

Closed, exactly because of who must agree on it: two strangers' devices, made
in different years by people who never met. An operator inventing a word here
would be back at `cmd:door-open`. A device asked for a state it does not have
-- `state:disco`, or `state:pressed`, which is a thing that happens and not a
thing that is made true -- answers `code:400`. New words need this document to
change, which is the cost of the only list everybody holds.

`level:` accompanies a state rather than implying one: `cmd:set state:on
level:40%` says both, and a report says both back. `target:` is the setpoint
counterpart of a measurement key -- `temp:` (section 10.3) reports what IS,
`target:` what the device is asked to hold:

```
76   t:observation f:X1HEAT temp:19.5C target:21C batt:64% ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00
```

**The result states what IS, not what was asked.** The keys of the command
come back carrying the condition the device actually reached, and the
`code:` table of section 25.1 needs nothing added:

```
151  t:result f:X1LAMP d:X1A67X ts:2026-08-19_18:30:05 r:1cc8af code:200 state:on level:40% sig:<60 characters>
```

**Reading a device is the existing request**, with one new word (section 7):

```
58   t:request f:X1A67X d:X1DOOR ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00 q:state
84   t:observation f:X1DOOR d:X1A67X state:locked batt:82% ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00 s:state
```

**And a sensor that has something to say just observes**, unsolicited, the
way every observation in section 10 already travels -- a doorbell press is
`state:pressed` with the owner in `d:`:

```
44   t:observation f:X1DOOR state:closed batt:82%
68   t:observation f:X1BELL d:X1A67X state:pressed ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00
```

**Section 25.4 is not optional here, and a lock is the reason it is written
the way it is.** The network is open; anyone in radio range can air a packet.
So: a `cmd:set` that is unsigned or fails verification is discarded, never
answered. A verified signer must still be on the allow-list the device's
owner holds, or the answer is `code:403`:

```
138  t:command f:X1RD89 d:X1DOOR ts:2026-08-19_18:30:00 cmd:set state:unlocked sig:<60 characters>
156  t:result f:X1DOOR d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-19_18:30:05 r:498c72 code:403 sig:<60 characters> m:not on the allow list
```

The 300-second window and the derived-identifier idempotency of section 25.4
are what keep a recorded `state:unlocked` from opening the door tomorrow,
and carriers drop commands rather than park them (section 25.4), because
later is what an act must never be. A report is different: `state:pressed`
from an unsigned doorbell is a claim like any observation, weighed like one
(section 10.5), and acted on by a person rather than a mechanism.

### 25.7.1 Controllers, and the X4 callsign

A pump has no radio. What it has is a controller -- an ESP32 on the wall, a
node in the shed -- that switches it, reads it, and speaks XPRS on its
behalf. The controller pattern is **one radio operating several devices**,
and the format gives each operated device a callsign of its own: `X4`
(section 3), derived from a keypair generated for that device, **whose
private half the controller holds**. On the air the controller is invisible:
a command is addressed `d:` to the device, and the answer comes back `f:`
the device, signed with the device's key -- the controller signing as its
proxy, which it can do for the same reason it can switch the pump.

The tempting shortcut is suffixes of the controller's own callsign --
`X3RLY7-1`, `X3RLY7-2` -- and it is wrong for the reason section 3.1 makes
plain: a suffix shares the callsign's key. Every device would sign with the
controller's key, so an allow-list could not name one device without naming
them all, and no device could ever be revoked, rotated or handed to a new
owner on its own. A keypair per device is what makes each one separately
addressable, separately allow-listed, and separately disownable: selling
the pump is handing over its private key, and a prudent buyer rotates it --
a new key, and with it a new callsign, because a key that changed hands is
not the key it was.

A controller says it operates devices, and each device then speaks for
itself -- an identity binding its callsign to its key, and observations as
any station airs them:

```
126  t:service f:X3RLY7 serve:relay,devices ts:2026-08-19_18:40:00 sig:<60 characters>
186  t:identity f:X4PL3M ts:2026-08-19_18:40:00 k:npub1pl3m7fu9j9uenmyva7ha6x9eqwymytv2847ccv4vxdmn45y50q7h7k5f nick:yard-pump sig:<60 characters>
66   t:observation f:X4PL3M state:off volt:23.8V ts:2026-08-19_18:40:00
```

Commanding it is section 25.7 unchanged, because an `X4` station is a
station:

```
132  t:command f:X1A67X d:X4PL3M ts:2026-08-19_18:41:00 cmd:set state:on sig:<60 characters>
141  t:result f:X4PL3M d:X1A67X ts:2026-08-19_18:41:02 r:44df54 code:200 state:on sig:<60 characters>
```

The allow-list of section 25.4 is kept **per device**, on the controller,
configured by the device's owner: the neighbour trusted to run the pump is
not thereby trusted to unlock the door, even when one ESP32 operates both.
Everything else follows from what `X4` already is. The prefix tells a
receiver the station is a machine acting under someone's configuration --
worth knowing before trusting its claims (section 10.5). It is
self-generated, so it never originates on licensed spectrum (section
9.4.1). And a controller that dies takes its devices off the air exactly as
any station goes silent, which is the honest signal: a lamp whose
controller is gone IS unreachable, and nothing in the format pretends
otherwise.

### 25.8 Keeping a station's firmware current

A station on a roof is the case this section exists for. Reaching it with
a cable costs a ladder, so it either updates over the air or it stays on
the version it was carried up with -- and a network of stations that can
never be fixed is a network whose worst bug is permanent.

**`cmd:update` asks a station to install firmware.** It is an actuation,
so section 25.4 applies in full and without exception: unsigned or
unverifiable is discarded and never answered, a verified signer must be on
the allow-list the owner holds or the answer is `code:403`, and the
command expires with the 300-second window.

```
126  t:command f:X1RD89 d:X3P7QK ts:2026-08-20_14:26:40 cmd:update sig:<60 characters>
136  t:command f:X1RD89 d:X3P7QK ts:2026-08-20_14:26:40 cmd:update ver:1.4.2 sig:<60 characters>
165  t:command f:X1RD89 d:X3P7QK ts:2026-08-20_14:26:40 cmd:update url:http://192.168.1.9/fw/m5-1.4.2.bin sig:<60 characters>
```

The bare form means "install what your configured source offers". `ver:`
pins a version, so a fleet lands on one build rather than on whatever each
node happened to find. `url:` names a source for this one install -- a
mirror on the local network, or a laptop on a bench -- and changes nothing
about what is accepted: the image still has to carry a signature the
station already trusts.

**A station accepts an image, never a source.** This is the rule the whole
section turns on. The bytes are authenticated by a signature made by the
key whose holder is entitled to publish firmware for that station, and
that signature is checked before a single byte is written to storage. A
hostile source -- a poisoned mirror, a lying DNS answer, an operator's own
mistake -- can therefore waste a station's airtime and cannot change what
it runs. It also means the transport needs no trust of its own: plain
HTTP, a phone on the station's own access point, or a peer handing over
bytes it already holds are all equally acceptable carriers.

**What is signed is not the image alone.** A bare digest is a hazard: the
same key signs this station's packets, and a signature over 32 bytes says
nothing about which 32 bytes were meant. The approval therefore covers a
line that no packet can produce -- a packet always begins `t:` -- naming
the product, the board, the version, the size and the image's digest
together:

```
xprsfw1 m5stack-core 1.4.2 1340320 3f7a1c...(64 lowercase hex)
```

So a build for one board can never be installed on another, and an
approval for one version can never be replayed as approval for the next.

**The station answers twice, and the second answer is the one that
matters.** `code:202` says the command was accepted and the work has
started. Minutes and one reboot later, the station says how it went, with
the same `r:` naming the original command:

```
132  t:result f:X3P7QK d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-20_14:26:41 r:9f2c41 code:202 sig:<60 characters>
141  t:result f:X3P7QK d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-20_14:33:12 r:9f2c41 code:200 fw:1.4.2 sig:<60 characters>
155  t:result f:X3P7QK d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-20_14:33:12 r:9f2c41 code:500 fw:1.4.1 sig:<60 characters> m:rolled back
```

`code:200` is aired by the NEW firmware after it has proved it works --
not when the bytes finished arriving, which proves only that bytes
arrived. `code:500` with the old version in `fw:` is aired by the OLD
firmware after the station put itself back, and it is the most valuable
packet in this section: a failed remote update reporting its own failure,
from a station nobody had to visit. `code:403` refuses a signer who is not
allowed, `code:408` one whose command has expired, `code:429` a station
already installing something, and `code:500` with `m:` a transfer that
arrived corrupt.

**A station that cannot go back should not go forward.** The reason this
is safe to do to a station on a roof is that the old firmware stays where
it is until the new one has earned its place: kept, unmodified, in the
slot it was running from, and restored automatically if the new one fails
to come up or fails to say it is well within a bounded time. A station
with room for only one firmware image may implement `cmd:update`, and
should answer `code:403` and say so, because an update that cannot be
undone is a decision the operator should make with a cable in hand.

**Every station says what it runs.** `fw:` on the periodic announcement
(section 24) costs about ten bytes and makes a fleet's version spread
visible to anyone already listening, without asking any station anything:

```
117  t:service f:X3P7QK serve:archive count:1234 fw:1.4.2 sig:<60 characters>
```

That is how an operator finds the three nodes still on last month's build,
and how a station that answers nothing at all still reports the one fact
that explains why.

**What this section does not do.** It does not say where firmware comes
from, who may publish it, or what a version string means -- those are the
operator's, exactly as section 25.4 says authorisation is (the allow-list
itself is set on the wire by section 25.9). And it defends nothing against
somebody standing at the station with a cable, which is deliberate: the owner
of a device is entitled to change what it runs, and a station that its owner
cannot repair is not a station they own.

### 25.9 Owning a station, and what the owner sets

Section 25.4 says a signature proves who sent a command and an allow-list
decides whether they may give it, and until here the list was the station's
private business: written into its configuration by whoever had a cable. That
is the right place for the check and the wrong place for the edit. A station
on a roof is set up once and then only ever reached by radio, and the person
who bought it is not the person who will edit a configuration file. So the
list goes on the wire, signed, as the command it always was -- and with it the
few things an owner decides for a station that serves other people: who may
talk through it, and whose traffic leaves first.

**A station with no owner asks for one.** Freshly flashed, or with its
configuration erased, it airs a request on its local bearers only, unsolicited
and metered like any other unasked traffic (section 31):

```
126  t:request f:X3RLY7 q:owner scope:local ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 sig:<60 characters>
```

`scope:local` because a claim is made by somebody standing next to the box,
and a station that asks the whole network for an owner will be given one it
did not want. The answer is a command, because it makes a state true:

```
136  t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:50 cmd:set owner:X1QZ3N sig:<60 characters>
145  t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:51 r:992d83 code:200 owner:X1QZ3N sig:<60 characters>
```

**An unowned station belongs to the first signer who claims it.** It accepts
the first `cmd:set owner:` that verifies, that names the signer in `owner:`,
and that arrived uncarried -- no `via:`, which section 25.4 already requires
of a command and which here is what keeps a claim from being made from across
the country. Every later claim from anyone else is `code:403`. There is no
pairing code and no button to press, and the window in which a stranger could
claim a station is the one between flashing it and answering it, which the
person flashing it controls.

**Ownership is a fact about the device, not about the network.** Nothing is
announced, nothing is recorded anywhere else, and erasing the station's
configuration -- reflashing it, or a factory reset -- makes it unowned again
and it starts asking. A station that cannot be reclaimed with a cable is not
one its owner can repair, which is the position section 25.8 takes about
firmware, and the same one is taken here. Selling the box is handing over the
box: erase it, and the buyer claims it.

**`owner:` is the allow-list of section 25.4, and only an owner may change it.**
It is a `path`, a comma-separated list of up to four callsigns, and the value
replaces the list rather than adding to it: a list that no longer names the
signer is a transfer, and a list that names four is full. A station with
several owners obeys any of them, and where two disagree the later `ts:` wins.

**What the owner sets, on `cmd:set`.** The command of section 25.7 already
carries its parameters in keys and answers with what IS, and a station's
policy is a state like any other, so it takes three more keys and one it
already has:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `owner` | `path` | who may command this station: the allow-list, on the wire |
| `use` | `enum` | who may originate traffic through it: `all`, `listed`, `owners`, `none` |
| `first` | `path` | senders whose packets leave the queue ahead of everyone else's |
| `serve` | `words` | what it does for others (section 24); `none` for nothing |

```
174  t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:30:00 cmd:set use:listed first:X1ABCD,X1EFGH serve:relay,archive sig:<60 characters>
196  t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:30:01 r:6cbbb6 code:200 owner:X1QZ3N use:listed first:X1ABCD,X1EFGH serve:relay,archive sig:<60 characters>
```

A key that is absent is unchanged, so an owner adjusts one thing without
restating the rest, and a `cmd:set` carrying only these keys and no `state:`
is a complete command. The result carries all four back whatever the command
carried, because a result states what IS (section 25.7), and the four together
are what is. A signer who is not an owner gets `code:403` for any of them, and
`state:`, `level:` and `target:` are untouched by this section: a lamp's
owner and the people allowed to switch it are not the same list, and section
25.4 still leaves that one to the device.

**`use:` is about the bridge.** A phone with no LoRa radio reaches the mesh by
handing a station a packet over Bluetooth or the local network and having the
station air it under the phone's own `f:`, and the station's owner decides who
may do that. `all` is a public station; `owners` a private one; `listed` is
the owners together with everyone in `first:`; `none` is a station that
relays and archives but originates for nobody. Two exceptions hold whatever
`use:` says, because a station that would not air a call for help from a
stranger is worse than no station: **`t:sos` and `t:warning` are aired for
anyone.** `serve:` is the station's announcement (section 24) made
settable: it thereafter announces exactly what its owner told it to, and a
station told `serve:none` announces nothing and does nothing for anyone,
which section 31.2 says is still a good citizen.

**Who goes first is fixed by this document, and the owner only fills in the
names.** When more than one packet waits for a bearer, a station airs them in
this order, and every station that queues for others airs them in the same
one:

1. `t:sos` and `t:warning`, before anything else at all;
2. packets whose `f:` is in `first:`;
3. by `urg:`, `urgent` before `high` before `normal` before `low`, with a
   stranger's packet counted no higher than `high` (section 13.5, and the
   quota policy in store-and-forward.md that it cites);
4. by `ts:`, oldest first.

The owner's named people rank above a stranger's stated urgency, not below
it, because section 13.5 already says what a stranger's `urg:urgent` is worth:
"stations will mark everything urgent". A name on `first:` was put there by
somebody who answers for it. That the owner cannot move `sos` down, or put
their own traffic above it, is the point of fixing the order here rather than
offering a key for it: a station's owner is entitled to decide who it serves,
and not entitled to bury a call for help under their own mail.

**Anybody may ask what the policy is**, so a phone learns whether a station
will carry for it before spending airtime finding out:

```
59  t:request f:X1MB7K d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:31:00 q:policy
192  t:observation f:X3RLY7 d:X1MB7K s:policy owner:X1QZ3N use:listed first:X1ABCD,X1EFGH serve:relay,archive ts:2026-08-08_14:31:01 sig:<60 characters>
```

`q:policy` and `s:policy` are the words of section 7 doing what they always
do, and the answer is an observation because that is what a state reported
unasked-for or asked-for has been since section 25.7.

**A policy survives a reboot, and an old one cannot be replayed.** Section
25.4 gives a command 300 seconds and a station's memory of one 600, which is
right for a door and wrong for a setting: a `cmd:set owner:` recorded today
and aired next year would verify, be fresh by the ring's standard, and hand
the station back to somebody who sold it. So a station keeps the `ts:` of the
last policy command it accepted, and a policy command whose `ts:` is not
later than that one is answered `code:408`, whatever the clock says now. The
same rule is what settles two owners who disagree: the later `ts:` is the
policy, on every station, in the same way.

**What this section does not do.** It does not put ownership on the air, so
nobody can find out from the network who owns a station, and there is nothing
to forge. It does not make `use:` a promise the station can be held to: a
station that says `use:all` still meters strangers under section 31.2 and may
answer `code:429`. And it does not tell a station what to do with a packet it
was handed and will not air, beyond the answer it already owes -- `code:403`,
out loud, because refusing quietly is what section 31.2 forbids.

---

## 26. Closed groups

An open group (section 6.3) has no door. Anyone may post to `LISBOA`, nobody may
be removed from it, and a single determined spammer or a persistently abusive
participant cannot be dealt with at all. That is fine for a calling channel and
useless for a community.

A **closed group** has a member list, one admin, and moderators. It changes
nothing about how packets travel and adds no enforcement anywhere: it lets a
group say who belongs, so a client can choose to show only those people.

### 26.1 A group is a station

A closed group holds a keypair, so it gets a callsign like anything else
(section 3):

```
X5A3F2
```

The admin is whoever holds the matching private key. **That key belongs to the
group, not to the person**, which is the property everything else in this
section rests on: an admin hands the group on by handing over the group's key,
and never has to share the private key of their own callsign to do it.

A group announces itself with the packet that already exists for announcing a
callsign and a key (section 9.3):

```
t:identity f:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 k:npub1qz3n7fu9j9uenmyva7ha6x9eqwymytv2847ccv4vxdmn45y50q7h7k5f nick:lisboa-net sig:<60 characters>
```

187 bytes. It is self-signed, which proves possession of the group's private key
(section 9.3), and `nick:` gives the group a readable name that is shown only
when the signature verifies (section 9.3.1). A group needs no announcement
packet of its own, no registry and no creation ceremony. It exists once somebody
generates a key and says so.

**An `X5` callsign is a label, exactly as every other callsign is.** An
attacker who wants a callsign that looks like `X5A3F2` can grind keys until one
produces those characters -- about a million tries at four characters, and about
a thousand at two, as the table in section 3 sets out. Section 3 already says
this and the answer is the same here: the group is its **full public key**, and
a receiver that has not verified a signature against that key has identified
nothing. Two groups wearing the same characters are two groups, and a client
that holds the key of one is not fooled by the other.

### 26.2 Subgroups

A large group wants smaller rooms inside it: a club with a VHF section and a
contest section, a marina with one channel per pontoon. **A subgroup is not a
new kind of thing.** It is an ordinary closed group, with its own keypair, its
own `X5` callsign, its own admin and its own roster, that some other group has
listed as part of itself.

Listing one is a grant like any other, and `role:sub` is what it grants:

```
138  t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 grant:X5K2M9 role:sub sig:<60 characters>
145  t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 grant:X5K2M9,X5T4WD role:sub sig:<60 characters>
130  t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 revoke:X5K2M9 sig:<60 characters>
```

Delisting is `revoke:`, the same packet that removes a person. A client that
follows `X5A3F2` reads its listings and shows the tree; each subgroup announces
its own name with its own `t:identity`, exactly as its parent does.

**Listing confers no authority.** This is the rule that keeps subgroups simple,
and it follows from the group being its key: `X5A3F2` saying that `X5K2M9` is
part of it does not let `X5A3F2` grant, revoke or hide anything inside
`X5K2M9`, because those acts are signed by `X5K2M9`'s key and nothing else will
verify. Nor does membership travel down: belonging to a parent is not belonging
to a subgroup, and each roster is read on its own.

That is a deliberate difference from moderation systems that walk a tree to
decide who may act, and it costs the parent admin nothing in practice: an admin
who wants authority over a subgroup creates it and keeps its key, which is the
ordinary case. Handing that key to somebody else is how a section gets its own
administration, and section 26.6 already describes what handing a group key over
means.

**Five levels, counting the root.** A client ignores a listing that would place
a group deeper than that, so a root has at most four generations beneath it. It
also ignores a listing that names a group already in its own ancestry, because a
cycle is not a tree and two groups listing each other must not become an
infinite one.

A listing is a claim by the parent and nothing more. Any group may list any `X5`
callsign, whether or not that group agreed, and there is no packet to prevent
it -- the same limit section 3 states about callsigns, for the same reason. What
bounds the damage is the rule above: a false listing borrows a name into a menu
and confers nothing, and it is visible only to clients already following the
group that made the claim.

### 26.3 Membership

One packet type carries every act of authority. The admin signs as the group:

```
136  t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 grant:X1RD89,X32DVA sig:<60 characters>
164  t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 grant:X32DVA role:mod until:2027-02-08_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
130  t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 revoke:X1PZ4Q sig:<60 characters>
```

`grant:` and `revoke:` take one or more callsigns, so admitting a dozen people
is one packet rather than a dozen. `role:mod` makes a moderator; without it the
grant makes an ordinary member. `f:` is always the signer and `d:` is always the
group the act concerns, so a moderator's act looks the same but is signed by
them:

```
156  t:moderate f:X32DVA d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 revoke:X1PZ4Q until:2026-08-15_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
138  t:moderate f:X32DVA d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:89a9c8 hide:message sig:<60 characters>
```

**A suspension is a revocation with an end.** `revoke:` alone removes somebody;
`revoke:` with `until:` removes them until that moment and no longer. `until:`
keeps the meaning it has everywhere else in this document -- when the sender
expects the condition to end -- and `revoke:` keeps the meaning it has with or
without it.

**A moderator may revoke and hide. Only the admin may appoint.** Two tiers is
the whole hierarchy. `hide:message` asks clients not to display the packet named
in `r:`; it cannot unsend anything, because nothing on a radio can.

There is no application packet. **Asking to join is an ordinary message to the
group**, which needs no new type and leaves no permanent signed record that a
person asked and was refused.

### 26.3.1 Nobody is a member without saying so

A grant is an **offer**. It confers nothing until the person named signs an
acceptance, and until then they are not a member, are not shown as one, and may
not post as one.

The reason is section 26.7: the roster is public, permanent and
non-repudiable. Without this rule an admin could put anybody into that
record -- a competitor, a stranger, somebody they wish to embarrass -- and the
person named would have no act anywhere in the log to answer it with. Consent
that leaves no trace is not consent.

The member signs as themselves, so `f:` is the member and `d:` is still the
group. It is the same shape a moderator's act already has, and it needs no new
packet type:

```
139  t:moderate f:X1RD89 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:9f2c1a accept:member sig:<60 characters>
136  t:moderate f:X32DVA d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:4b81e7 accept:mod sig:<60 characters>
128  t:moderate f:X1RD89 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 leave:group sig:<60 characters>
```

`r:` names the grant being accepted, which is what makes the acceptance
evidence rather than a floating assertion: it says *this* offer, at *this*
moment, and a grant that was later withdrawn cannot be accepted after the fact.
It is the use `r:` already has in `r:<id> hide:message`.

`leave:group` is the other half, and it exists for the same reason. Leaving is
the member's to decide and needs nobody's agreement, so it takes no `r:`. What
it leaves behind is the point: a signed record that the person went, rather
than a silence an admin could explain any way they liked.

**A `role:sub` listing needs no acceptance.** A subgroup is a group, not a
person; section 26.2 already says a listing "is a claim by the parent and
nothing more" and confers nothing. Asking a keypair to consent would be
ceremony without meaning.

**A `revoke:` needs no acceptance either.** Removal is the group's to decide.
Only joining requires agreement from both sides, because only joining puts a
person's name in somebody else's record.

### 26.4 Reading the log

Every act is signed and they accumulate; a client replays what it has heard.
Three rules decide what the result is, and they exist so that two
implementations reach the same answer from the same packets.

**Authority is judged at the moment of the act.** A moderator's `revoke:` counts
if that callsign held `role:mod` at the act's `ts:`, whatever their status now.
Otherwise removing a moderator would either silently undo a year of legitimate
moderation, or leave an abusive one's suspensions standing for ever.

**Newest wins, per signer.** Where one signer contradicts themselves, the later
`ts:` stands; where two acts share a `ts:`, the smaller identifier (section 5)
stands, so a tie is broken the same way everywhere. A `ts:` more than a few
minutes in the future is discarded, or a rogue moderator would win every
disagreement for ever by dating a packet to 2030. An `until:` more than a year
past its own `ts:` is discarded for the same reason.

**The admin can void a moderator's record.** `revoke:` with `since:` withdraws
the moderator and everything they did from that moment:

```
156  t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 revoke:X32DVA since:2026-08-01_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

Without it, a compromised moderator key that suspends fifty people costs fifty
packets to undo, each one a packet that is unsafe to lose.

**A grant naming a person is pending until its acceptance is heard.** Membership
begins at the acceptance's `ts:`, and only if the grant was in force at that
moment -- a grant already revoked cannot be accepted afterwards. A pending grant
is not membership: it is not shown as one and it confers no right to post. A
client that holds the grant but not the acceptance therefore reports the person
as invited, not as absent, because those are different facts and only one of
them is the person's doing.

**Consent does not carry across a departure.** After `leave:group`, a later
grant needs a new acceptance. The alternative would let an admin re-add
somebody who left by replaying an old offer, which is the harm section 26.3.1
exists to prevent, arriving by another door.

**Removal needs no acceptance**, so a `revoke:` takes effect at its own `ts:`
under the rules above and nothing waits on the person removed.

Note what is **not** inherited from section 13.12.1: a mailbox declaration is
chosen by the narrowest window containing the moment, and membership is not.
Narrowest-window-wins would demote a moderator the instant any narrower grant
existed.

### 26.5 Expiry, and what a quiet group does

`until:` on a grant is optional, exactly as it is on a mailbox declaration
(section 13.12.1): a grant without one is open-ended and stays in force. A
revocation is kept indefinitely, because a client that forgets one and then
hears a replay of the grant it cancelled would readmit somebody who was removed.

The asymmetry is deliberate and worth stating the other way round: **losing a
grant is safe and losing a revocation is not**, so the format keeps revocations
and lets grants stand.

`until:` on a moderator's grant is the closest thing to cleanup this section
offers, and it is enough. A moderator who stops operating falls off when their
grant expires, with no vote, no timer and no act by anybody.

### 26.6 When the admin is gone

**Succession is handing over the key.** The outgoing admin gives the group's
private key to whoever takes it on; the callsign, the roster and every past
grant stay valid, because the root of trust has not moved. There is no heir
packet and no inactivity rule.

**There is deliberately no mechanism that infers an absent admin from silence.**
A healthy group with no membership churn emits no admin packets at all, so any
such timer fires on an admin who is present and simply had nothing to sign.
Section 18.5 already refuses this inference for challenges -- "treating silence
as guilt would make the network hostile to the small stations it exists
for" -- and it is worse here, because clients that heard different packets would
promote different successors and split the group permanently, with no way for
either side to notice.

Three costs come with key handover, and none of them has a protocol answer:

- **It cannot be undone.** The previous holder keeps a copy.
- **A leaked key is permanent.** Anyone with it is indistinguishable from the
  admin.
- **The key cannot be rotated**, because the callsign derives from it. A new key
  is a new group.

The remedy in every one of those cases is the same, and it is social rather than
technical: found a new group and move to it. That is what a community does
anyway when its administration fails, it needs no packet, and unlike an
automatic succession it cannot silently fork a group in two.

### 26.7 What a client shows

Membership decides display and nothing else. A closed group is not a private
one, and three rules keep the difference honest.

**Safety traffic is never filtered.** `t:sos`, `t:warning`, `t:info` and direct
replies to them are shown whatever the roster says. A member whose grant a
receiver never heard must not have their call for help hidden by their own
group; section 15 makes the same argument about encryption, and it applies here
with more force, because a missing grant is an accident rather than a choice.

**A client that cannot verify fails open, and says so.** Without the group's
key, or knowing its own grant set is incomplete, it shows everything and marks
the group unverified. A closed group whose announcements have not arrived must
look broken rather than empty, since the alternative is a silent, invisible
failure that looks exactly like nobody talking.

**The roster is public, permanent and non-repudiable.** Grants have to reach
strangers for anyone to bootstrap, so they cannot be sealed with `x:` or held
back with `scope:local`. What a closed group publishes is a signed list of
everyone who belongs -- including members who never speak -- and a complete
history of who suspended whom and when, gatewayed to the internet like anything
else. That is **more** exposure than an open group, where only the people who
talk are visible. A group that needs its membership kept secret cannot have it
this way. `x:` conceals what is said and nothing conceals who belongs, because
the roster is what a stranger must read in order to honour it at all.

None of this contradicts section 13.11.3. A group is still an address and not a
boundary: anyone can still transmit to `X5A3F2` and everyone in range still
hears it. Design rule 6 also stands -- every packet remains fully readable with
no prior state, and the roster changes only what a client chooses to **show**.

### 26.8 Bootstrap, and not becoming a weapon

Any member may rebroadcast the grants it holds. They are signed by the group, so
a newcomer verifies them against the group's key and needs to trust the
rebroadcaster not at all.

Two limits keep that from being an amplifier, both following section 18.4:

- A station answers a bounded number of roster requests per period and ignores
  the rest.
- It answers the station that asked, never a broadcast.

A rebroadcast is a relay and not a new origination, so it stays under the limit
of section 13.1 and does not earn a fresh three hops by being re-signed.

### 26.9 Propagation and discovery

Sections 26.1 to 26.8 say what a group is and who may act in it. They do not
say how a group's traffic travels or how a station finds one, and without that
a group works only among stations already in earshot of each other.

Nothing here is a new bearer or a new sync protocol. A group is a station, its
acts are ordinary signed packets, and they spread the way every other packet
does. What follows is only what a station may say about the groups it keeps,
and what it may promise.

#### 26.9.1 Hosting is a directory line

A station that keeps a group's traffic says so the way section 36.9 already
says everything of this kind: the group's `X5` callsign appears as a line in
the archiver's XDIR1 directory, and the directory is named by `file:` on its
signed `t:service`.

There is no new field, and deliberately nothing on the beacon. An `X5`
callsign is a callsign (section 26.1), so a directory line naming a group is
already legal and already means what it needs to mean. A beacon is the wrong
place twice over: section 31.1 asks that service announcements go out "on a
period measured in tens of minutes rather than seconds", and a list that grows
with the number of groups kept has no bounded size to fit beside `hears:`.

**A hosting line is a claim about capability, not about completeness.** It
means *ask me about this group*. It does not say how far back the station holds,
and section 31.3 already forbids saying so: "the claim is 'ask me', never 'I
hold everything since a date'". A station that keeps one week of a group and a
station that keeps five years publish the same line.

#### 26.9.2 Depositing a group's traffic

Any member may hand a group's packets to an archiver, and to a super-archiver
in particular. This is section 26.8's rebroadcast with a destination: the
packets are signed by the group and by their authors, so the archiver trusts
the depositor for nothing and verifies everything.

Two limits, both already stated elsewhere and both binding here:

- A deposit is **addressed, never broadcast** (26.8), because a deposit is
  work asked of one station rather than an announcement to the room.
- A deposit is **metered**. Section 31.2 is the rule -- "serving a stranger is
  optional and metered" -- so an archiver over budget answers `code:429` and
  names an alternative in `m:try` where it knows one, rather than going quiet.
  Section 31.1's "a retry is not a new packet" applies to the depositor: a
  deposit that went unanswered is re-sent against the same budget as the first.

#### 26.9.3 What an archiver keeps

An archiver may bound what it keeps for any one group: a byte ceiling per `X5`
callsign, and within that ceiling the oldest goes first.

Section 36.11 already orders eviction by class and then by age, over three
classes -- the spool, undeclared custody mail, and declared mail. A group is
none of those. Its traffic is addressed to an `X5` rather than to a person, and
no `hold:` declaration governs it, so under 36.11 alone a group's history is
evicted by global age: one loud group crowds out every quiet one, and a small
group that speaks once a month loses its whole record to a busy month
elsewhere. A per-group ceiling is the smallest rule that prevents this, and it
is a fourth axis on 36.11 rather than a change to the three it has.

This changes nothing a client may assume. Section 31.3 already says a client
"must never assume any depth exists", so a group's history being bounded, and
bounded differently at every archiver, is the condition clients are already
required to tolerate. An archiver that evicts says nothing about it: there is
no packet announcing what was dropped, because a station that could hear such
an announcement could equally have asked.

# Part VIII. Community

Presence, polls, reports and named places.

## 27. Status

`t:status` is a short post about the sender, now. It is the packet a townhall is
made of: everybody publishes, everybody sees, and a client renders them in a
timeline newest first.

```
t:status f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 m:tied up in Sagres, the wind finally dropped
```

86 bytes. `d:` is absent, so it is published to anyone in range. A status
carrying `d:` goes to that group's timeline instead of the global one, whether
the group is an open name or a closed `X5` (section 26).

**Neither existing type would do.** A `t:blog` post is a document: it has a
`title:`, and a later post with the same title replaces it (section 19.1). Two
statuses an hour apart are two moments and not a correction of each other, so a
status has no title and never replaces anything. A broadcast `t:message` is
conversational and spoken to whoever is listening now; a status is published,
kept, and read later by people who were not, which is the distinction section 19
already draws between a message and a post.

Everything else a status needs already exists. `pos:` says where it was written,
`file:` attaches a photograph, `tag:` files it, `lang:` names its language,
`cw:` warns what it contains, `scope:` keeps it off the internet, `n:` splits a
long one across up to nine parts (section 6.6), and `sig:` signs it. A status
takes replies and reactions, which is most of the point of publishing one.

### 27.1 Mood

`mood:` says how the sender feels, so that a client can dress itself to match --
a colour, a background, an icon beside the post.

```
t:status f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 mood:becalmed m:no wind since dawn, going nowhere
```

90 bytes. It is optional, and the four bytes it costs beyond the word itself buy
a client everything it needs to theme a screen without parsing the text.

The value is one word from the list below and nothing else. A receiver that does
not recognise a value skips it (section 4.3) and shows the post plainly, which
is the correct outcome: the post is the content and the mood is decoration.

| Family | Word | What it says |
|---|---|---|
| general | `blessed` | fortunate, and aware of it |
| general | `grateful` | thankful to somebody in particular |
| general | `happy` | plainly glad |
| general | `sad` | plainly not |
| general | `tired` | worn down rather than sleepy |
| general | `lonely` | alone and minding it |
| general | `proud` | pleased with something done |
| general | `worried` | expecting trouble |
| general | `calm` | settled, nothing pressing |
| general | `determined` | set on finishing something |
| sea | `becalmed` | no wind, going nowhere |
| sea | `adrift` | unmoored, in the head or the hull |
| sea | `anchored` | held somewhere safe |
| sea | `seasick` | exactly that |
| sea | `salty` | weathered and cheerful about it |
| sea | `stormbound` | kept in shelter by weather |
| sea | `landsick` | ashore and missing the sea |
| sea | `soaked` | wet through |
| sea | `homebound` | on the way back |
| sea | `windblown` | battered by a long day on deck |
| mountain | `summited` | on top, and it was worth it |
| mountain | `breathless` | thin air, not fear |
| mountain | `snowbound` | cannot move for snow |
| mountain | `frostbitten` | cold has done damage |
| mountain | `footsore` | too many miles today |
| mountain | `exposed` | on a face, nothing between you and the weather |
| mountain | `sheltered` | out of it at last |
| mountain | `benighted` | caught out by darkness |
| mountain | `acclimatised` | the altitude has stopped mattering |
| mountain | `whiteout` | cannot see, cannot navigate |

Thirty words in three families. The families are there so a client can theme by
family and refine later, rather than needing thirty palettes on the first day.

```
t:status f:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 mood:summited pos:42.6390,0.6560 m:top of Aneto, clear all the way to France
t:status f:X1QZ3N d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 mood:stormbound sig:<60 characters> m:staying put another day
```

117 and 156 bytes.

**A closed list is not a cage.** Section 4.9 reserves every key beginning with
`z` for private use, so a community that wants a mood this document does not
have writes `zmood:stoked` beside the standard one, and every other receiver
skips it without error.

`mood:` is defined here and, like any key, may appear on any packet the sender
chooses -- on a `t:blog` post it reads perfectly well. What it must never do is
change how a packet is treated. A mood is not a priority, does not earn a relay,
and does not raise a notification; `urg:` (section 13.5) is the field that
speaks to the network, and `sev:` (section 16) is the one that speaks to
danger.

### 27.2 What a status is not

**Not carried.** Store-and-forward (section 13.4) delivers to a recipient, and a
broadcast status has none. A status that missed its audience is simply a post
nobody read, which is an ordinary thing for a post.

**Not privileged.** Three relays, the default of section 13.1. A townhall post
is not an emergency and must not compete with one.

**No follow packet.** A client keeps its own list of the callsigns whose
statuses it shows, and that list stays on the device. Publishing it would put a
permanent public record of who reads whom on the air -- the same leak section
26.7 describes for rosters -- and buys nothing that a local list does not
already give.

---

## 28. Polls

`t:poll` asks everybody the same question and counts the answers.

```
t:poll f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 opt:sagres,lagos,portimao until:2026-08-10_18:00:00 m:where shall we meet for the net?
```

134 bytes, identifier `7a9b50`. `opt:` carries the choices as comma-separated
labels and `m:` asks the question. A poll to a group carries `d:` like anything
else; without it, it is put to whoever is in range.

`opt:` takes **two to six** options, each a `label` (lowercase letters, digits
and `-`). Two because a poll with one option is not a question, and six because
a person choosing on a phone in a cockpit is not reading a menu -- and because
the options, the question and the envelope share 250 bytes.

### 28.1 `until:` is required

**A poll states when voting closes, always.** `until:` is the one field a poll
may not omit, and a poll without it is incomplete: a counter does not count
votes for it, and a client shows it as a question rather than a ballot.

This is the only field in the format that is required by its type rather than by
its packet, and the reason is that the alternative is worse. A poll with no
closing time never resolves. It sits in every spool that keeps it, collects
votes from stations coming back into range for as long as anybody replays it,
and has a different answer every time it is counted -- for ever, with no moment
at which anyone may say what the answer was. Section 31.3 makes that concrete:
a station may keep a followed callsign's traffic indefinitely, so "eventually
it ages out" is not true here.

Nothing about the requirement changes how a receiver **parses** a poll. Design
rule 4 stands: an unknown or absent field is skipped and the packet still reads.
What a missing `until:` costs is the count, not the parse.

The same key already carries this weight elsewhere: a carried packet must state
`until:` (section 13.4), for the same reason -- work with no deadline is work
nobody can ever stop doing.

### 28.2 Bounding who is being asked

A poll may narrow its audience with fields the format already has, and needs no
new ones:

```
133  t:poll f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 opt:yes,no scope:local until:2026-08-09_20:00:00 m:should we move the net to Sundays?
137  t:poll f:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 opt:yes,no pos:37.0194,-7.9304 rad:20km until:2026-08-09_20:00:00 m:is anyone still without power?
131  t:poll f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 opt:sagres,lagos,portimao until:2026-08-10_18:00:00 lang:PT m:onde nos encontramos?
```

| Field | Narrows the poll to |
|---|---|
| `d:` | one group, open or closed (section 26) |
| `scope:` | `local` for the bearers in range now, or ISO country codes (section 13.11) |
| `pos:` with `rad:` | people within that radius of that point |
| `lang:` | people who read that language (section 4.7) |
| `cw:` | nobody -- it warns what the question contains before it renders |

**These say who is being asked. They do not say who may answer**, and the
difference is the same one section 26.7 draws about rosters. Anybody in range
hears the poll, anybody may transmit a vote, and no field prevents it. What the
fields do is tell a counter which votes belong in the answer and tell a client
whether to put the question in front of its operator at all.

A counter should therefore be honest about what it can actually check. `d:` and
`lang:` it can read off the packets. `scope:` it can apply to its own bearers.
**`rad:` it usually cannot check at all**, because a vote carries no position
unless the voter chose to include one, and requiring a position to vote asks
somebody to disclose where they are in order to answer a question. A poll
bounded by radius is a poll asked politely of a region, not a constituency with
a roll.

### 28.3 Voting is a reaction

A vote needs no packet type of its own, because the format already has one that
behaves exactly like a ballot:

```
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:7a9b50 vote:sagres
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:7a9b50 remove:vote
```

49 bytes each. Section 6.5 already says a reaction is **counted once per
callsign, is idempotent, is not displayed as a message and raises no
notification**, which is the whole specification of a vote. `vote:` names the
chosen option and `r:` names the poll.

**Changing your mind is voting again.** The newest verifiable vote from a
callsign stands, decided by `ts:`, exactly as a nickname is replaced (section
9.3.1). `remove:vote` withdraws a vote without replacing it.

A vote for an option the poll does not offer is discarded rather than counted as
something else, and a vote arriving after `until:` is counted only if the
counter chooses to -- both stations may reasonably disagree about when the
deadline passed, and see below.

### 28.4 The count is local, and provisional

**There is no authoritative result and this format will not pretend otherwise.**
Every station counts the votes it has actually heard, and no two stations on a
radio network have heard the same set. A poll that closed an hour ago is still
gaining votes on the far side of a relay that has just come back up.

There is no engineering that away; it is what counting on a lossy
broadcast medium means. What follows from it:

- **Show the count as what it is** -- votes heard, not votes cast. A client that
  displays "7 for sagres" where it means "7 that reached me" has lied by
  rounding.
- **The author's tally is not special.** The station that asked has no more
  authority over the result than anyone else; it simply usually hears more. If a
  final figure matters, the author publishes one as an ordinary `t:status` or a
  reply, signed, and it is a claim like any other claim.
- **`cmd:history` improves a count** (section 25.2) and never completes it.

### 28.5 A poll is not a secret ballot

Every vote is a signed packet naming a callsign and a choice, transmitted in
clear to anybody in range and relayed onward. **Who voted for what is public,
permanently, to everyone.**

This cannot be fixed within the format. Sealing a vote with `x:` hides it from
bystanders and not from the counter, and a vote nobody can read is a vote nobody
can count. Anonymity on a broadcast medium needs cryptography this document does
not have and a trusted counter this network does not want.

So: use `t:poll` for what time the net should start and where to meet. Do not
use it to elect anybody, and do not use it for a question whose answer could
cost somebody something.

---

## 29. Reporting

`t:report` says that a packet is spam, abuse, or something worse. It is the one
thing a station can do about bad traffic that is not inside a closed group,
where section 26 gives a moderator `hide:` and everywhere else gives nobody
anything.

```
133  t:report f:X32DVA d:X5A3F2 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:399227 kind:spam sig:<60 characters>
164  t:report f:X32DVA ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:399227 kind:abuse sig:<60 characters> m:same text to every group all morning
```

`r:` names the packet being reported and `kind:` says why. `d:` aims the report
at a group, whose admin and moderators are the people most able to act; without
it the report is made to whoever is listening.

| `kind:` | The packet is |
|---|---|
| `spam` | repetitive, automated, or sent to be seen rather than read |
| `abuse` | directed at somebody, and meant to harm them |
| `illegal` | unlawful where the reporter is |
| `false` | a claim the reporter believes is untrue and dangerous |
| `other` | something else, described in `m:` |

`kind:` needs no new key. It already means "what kind of thing this is" for a
warning, a channel and a place, and this is the fourth vocabulary it carries.

### 29.1 A report is a claim, never a verdict

**Nothing happens automatically because a report exists.** A report is not
moderation: `hide:` (section 26.3) is the only packet in this format that hides
anything, it works only inside one closed group, and only a moderator of that
group may send it. A report is one station's opinion, offered to whoever finds
it useful.

**A report must be signed.** An anonymous accusation is worth nothing to a
receiver and costs the accused something, which is the worst possible ratio. An
unsigned or unverifiable report is discarded.

**Reports are themselves an attack.** Mass false reporting is the obvious one:
twenty signed reports naming an innocent station cost an attacker nothing but
airtime, and a client that counts reports without weighing who sent them has
built a way to silence anybody. **A report counts for as much as its signer's
standing with the receiver and no more** -- which is a local judgement, like
every other judgement in this format, and cannot be delegated to the network.

**Reporting is not blocking.** A station that wants to stop seeing somebody
mutes them locally and needs no packet and nobody's permission. A report is for
telling other people, and the two should not be confused in a user interface:
one is a private decision, the other is a public statement about somebody else.

---

## 30. Places

Every packet so far reports the sender: where I am, what I see, how I feel. A
place reports **something that is not me and does not move** -- a tap on a
harbour wall, a mooring buoy, a bothy, the one gap in a wall of gorse. APRS has
had this for thirty years as Objects and Items, and a format aimed at people at
sea and in mountains cannot do without it.

```
t:place f:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 kind:anchorage pos:37.0194,-7.9304 title:baleeira m:good holding in sand, exposed to south
```

130 bytes. `kind:` says what it is, `pos:` where it is, and `title:` names it.

`kind:` needs no new key: it already means "what kind of thing this is" for a
warning and for a channel, and this is the third vocabulary it carries.

| Word | The place |
|---|---|
| `anchorage` | somewhere to lie at anchor |
| `mooring` | a buoy or pile to make fast to |
| `ramp` | a slipway |
| `jetty` | a pontoon or quay to come alongside |
| `beach` | somewhere to land a small boat |
| `fuel` | diesel, petrol or gas |
| `water` | drinking water |
| `repair` | a yard, a chandlery, somebody who mends things |
| `shelter` | out of the weather, unstaffed |
| `hut` | a refuge or bothy, walls and a roof |
| `camp` | somewhere a tent goes |
| `spring` | water out of the ground |
| `ford` | a crossing |
| `pass` | a way through a ridge |
| `summit` | a top |
| `trailhead` | where a path starts |
| `other` | something not in this list, described in `m:` |

### 30.1 Naming, revising and withdrawing

`title:` is a `label` and works exactly as it does on a post (section 19.1): a
later place from the same station with the same title **replaces** the earlier
one. That is how a place is corrected when the tap is moved or the buoy is
lifted, and it is why a place needs no separate revision mechanism.

`until:` makes a place temporary -- a water point that runs dry in August, a
winter-only shelter. `file:` attaches a photograph, which for a landing beach
is worth more than any description. `remove:place` withdraws one:

```
t:place f:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 kind:water pos:37.0194,-7.9304 title:sagres-tap sig:<60 characters> m:tap by the harbour office, potable
t:place f:X1BOA3 ts:2026-09-01_09:00:00 r:9f52f6 remove:place sig:<60 characters>
```

189 and 126 bytes.

### 30.2 A place is a claim

Nothing here is a survey and no station is an authority. Two people may publish
different places with the same title, or the same place in different positions,
and both are true statements about what somebody believed.

The rules are the ones this format uses everywhere else. **Newest wins per
signer**, so a station corrects itself and never anybody else. **A client shows
who said it**, because on a coast where a mistake grounds a boat, the callsign
that reported the anchorage is part of the information. **An unsigned place is a
claim by nobody**, and a client is right to rank it below one it can verify.

A place that matters for safety is not a place. A hazard is `t:warning` and a
call for help is `t:sos`; both carry a relay budget this type does not, and both
are the right packet when somebody could be hurt.

---

# Part IX. Operating rules

Airtime budgets, how the format grows without breaking a deployed
receiver, and the line drawn where XPRS meets APRS.

## 31. Airtime

Every other section says what a station **may** transmit. This one says how
often, and what it owes the strangers who ask it for things. Sections 25.2 and
13.12 make that urgent: `cmd:history` and `cmd:file` let one station ask another
to spend real airtime on demand, and a format that hands out that power without
a budget has designed a way to flatten a solar node from across a bay.

### 31.1 Cadence belongs to the bearer

There is no single right interval, because the constraint is not the same on
each bearer:

| Bearer | What binds |
|---|---|
| LoRa on ISM | a legal duty cycle, often 1 percent -- at SF9 a single packet owes several seconds of silence |
| VHF and UHF packet | a shared channel and whoever else is on it |
| Bluetooth and WiFi Direct | range, so traffic is naturally local and cheap |
| the internet | nothing, which is the trap |

**A station transmits unsolicited traffic no more often than the strictest
bearer it is transmitting on allows.** A phone that gateways to both LoRa and
the internet is bound by LoRa, not by the internet, for anything it sends to
both.

Two consequences worth stating, because both have been got wrong in practice:
**a beacon is not free**, so position, identity and service announcements go out
on a period measured in tens of minutes rather than seconds; and **a retry is
not a new packet**, so re-airing something that went unanswered counts against
the same budget as saying it the first time.

Section 13.7.2 says when to stop re-airing altogether: a retry is spent only
against evidence that the peer can still be reached, because a station that
cannot hear its peer learns nothing by transmitting at it again -- and a few
stations each nursing undelivered messages for peers that left can hold a
frequency down between them while delivering nothing at all.

### 31.2 What a station owes a stranger

`cmd:history` and `cmd:file` are requests to spend somebody else's battery. The
answer is not that they must be refused, and not that they must be honoured.

- **Serving yourself is unmetered; serving a stranger is optional and metered.**
  A station decides what it gives away, and a station that gives away nothing is
  still a good citizen of this network.
- **A bounded number of answers per period.** Section 18.4 already sets this
  precedent for challenges, and the reasoning transfers unchanged: an unlimited
  right to demand work from a battery-powered station is a way to flatten it.
- **Refuse out loud.** Over budget, a station answers `code:429` rather than
going quiet, and names in `m:` any station it knows that serves the same thing:

```
t:result f:X3RLY7 d:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 r:747ae8 code:429 sig:<60 characters> m:try X32DVA or CT1ABC-9
```

157 bytes. Silence and refusal look identical to the asker and mean opposite
things, so a refusal that says nothing wastes the very airtime it was trying to
save: the asker retries, reasonably, believing the packet was lost.

### 31.3 Retention belongs to the station

**This document states no retention period, and will not.** There is no minimum
depth, no maximum, no required eviction order, and no obligation to keep
anything at all. A hosting station and the software it runs decide what to keep,
for how long, and for whom -- and change that decision whenever storage,
battery, bandwidth or interest changes.

The omission is deliberate. The stations on this network are a dongle with a
microSD card, a phone that is someone's only computer, and a home server with a
spare terabyte. Any number this document picked would be an overstatement for
the first and an insult to the third, and it would be wrong again the day
somebody adds a disk.

**A spool is not a time window, and this is why no station can usefully publish
one number for it.** Keeping is a judgement about worth, not about age. A
station holds the notes of the people its operator follows and never drops
them; it keeps whatever recorded something that mattered -- a rescue, a storm,
a passage that went wrong -- long after everything around it is gone; and it
discards a stranger's chatter within hours of hearing it. Ask such a station
"how far back do you go" and there is no honest answer: it goes back a year for
one callsign and an afternoon for the next.

So a station advertises `serve:archive` and nothing more. **The claim is "ask
me", never "I hold everything since a date"**, and a station that keeps four
hours of strangers should not dress that up as four months.

What it owes beyond that is plainness in the answer: **`code:404` for a window
it does not hold**, without apology or explanation. Nothing was promised, so
nothing has failed.

The consequence for the asking side is the one that matters. **A client must
never assume any depth exists.** It asks, takes what arrives, and asks somebody
else for the rest. Because a replay is the original packets and duplicates
collapse on their identifiers (section 25.2.1), asking three stations with
overlapping spools is not waste -- it is how a network with no guaranteed
retention still reassembles a week nobody was awake for.

Durability here is social rather than technical: several stations keeping
overlapping spools by their own choice, not one station promising to remember.

### 31.4 Who this protects

The stations worth protecting are the ones that cannot argue back: a solar relay
on a headland, a dongle in a hut, a phone at four percent in a tent. They are
also the stations that make the network reach anywhere interesting.

A budget is therefore not a limitation on generosity but the thing that makes
generosity survivable. A relay that serves until its battery dies has served
nobody by morning.

## 32. Adding a field, worked

A format is judged by what it costs to add something it did not foresee. Suppose
a station gains an air-quality sensor.

The implementer takes an unused key, gives it a type and a unit, and transmits
it:

```
t:observation f:X3WX01 pos:38.7223,-9.1393 temp:14.2C zpm:8 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

82 bytes. The new field costs six bytes. Every existing receiver reads `zpm:8`,
does not recognise the key, skips it, and continues at `ts:`. Nothing is
versioned, nothing is negotiated, and no other field is affected.

The key begins with `z` because unassigned keys belong in the private space. If
this document later assigns it, the entry is added to the table in section 10.3
with its type and unit, and a shorter key may be chosen; nothing else changes.

The same holds for a new word in `q:` and `s:`. A station asking `q:pos,co2`
gets `s:pos` from every station built before CO2 existed, with no error and no
negotiation.

---

## 33. Operating alongside APRS

A licensed amateur may bridge XPRS and APRS under their own callsign and
responsibility, subject to section 9.4. An `X1`, `X2` or `X3` callsign is generated
by the station itself and assigned by no authority, so traffic from such a callsign
must not be originated onto amateur infrastructure. Ciphertext must never be
placed on APRS, both because APRS is a 7-bit protocol that would corrupt it and
because obscured meaning is not permitted on amateur bands.

# Part X. Reference

The registries -- every assigned type, key and word -- and the whole
format on a few pages.

## 34. Reserved

Assigned packet types: `message`, `observation`, `receipt`, `reaction`,
`request`, `identity`, `track`, `sos`, `warning`, `info`, `challenge`,
`response`, `blog`, `passage`, `event`, `offer`, `need`, `channel`, `mailbox`,
`service`, `command`, `result`, `moderate`, `status`, `place`, `poll`, `file`,
`report`, `ping`, `pong`.
All other lowercase words are reserved.

`link`, `busy`, `txtime`, `hears`, `peers`, `mail`, `age`, `epoch`.

Assigned `q:` and `s:` words: section 8.

Reserved prefix: `z`, for both keys and words.

A new field takes an unused key and inherits the skip-unknown rule. A new
purpose takes an unused type. Neither redefines an existing assignment.

---

## 35. Cheat sheet

Everything the format defines, on one page. Each entry is stated in full in the
section it belongs to; nothing here is new.

```
key:value key:value key:value ...
```

Fields separated by one space. `t:` first, `m:` last, and only `m:` may contain
spaces. Keys are 1 to 6 characters, lowercase letters and digits, beginning with
a letter. An unknown key or an unknown type is skipped, never an error. Maximum
packet **250 bytes**, on every transport.

| no clock, no storage | `age` | `age:30` | seconds between observation and transmission |
| no clock, persistent storage | `epoch` | `epoch:7.4210` | boot epoch 7, 4210 seconds into that epoch |

`ts:` is when the packet was written; `since:` and `until:` are when the thing
it describes begins and ends. All are `YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS` in UTC. `tz:`
carries the sender's offset, for display only.

### Units

Every measurement carries its unit, immediately after the number, with no space.

| Quantity | Units | Canonical |
|---|---|---|
| distance, altitude | `m`, `km`, `ft`, `mi`, `nmi` | `m` |
| speed | `m/s`, `km/h`, `mph`, `kt` | `m/s` |
| angle | `deg`, `degm` | `deg` |
| temperature | `C`, `F` | `C` |
| pressure | `hPa`, `inHg` | `hPa` |

| electric field | `V/m`, `kV/m` | `V/m` |
| magnetic flux density | `nT`, `uT`, `mT`, `mG` | `uT` |

`deg` is true and `degm` is magnetic. A receiver converts to the canonical unit
before comparing, storing or plotting. `pos:` is the one measurement with no
unit: always decimal degrees, WGS84.

### Numbers

The decimal separator is `.`, never `,`, because a comma already separates
latitude from longitude and words in a list. No thousands separator:
`alt:11240m`. Leading `-` for negative, no `+`, no exponent. A digit before the
dot, never a trailing dot. Trailing zeros are significant.

### Asking and answering

`q:` asks and `s:` answers with the same words, several separated by commas.

Assigned: `ack`, `read`, `sign`, `pos`, `batt`, `identity`, `pong`, `have`,
`state`, `no`.

`s:no` means the request will not be served at all. A partial answer names only
what it satisfied.

A direct message between two stations that have exchanged one before is answered
with `t:receipt ... s:ack` **without** `q:ack` (section 13.7.1). Broadcasts,
group and regional messages, receipts, and strangers are never answered
automatically.

### What a station is, or is riding on

`type:`

| Group | Values |
|---|---|
| On foot | `foot`, `run`, `ski`, `horse` |
| Cycles | `bike`, `ebike`, `motorcycle` |
| Road | `car`, `bus`, `truck`, `tractor`, `emergency` |
| Rail | `train`, `tram` |
| Water | `boat`, `sailboat`, `ship`, `kayak` |
| Air | `airplane`, `helicopter`, `glider`, `balloon`, `drone` |
| Fixed | `node`, `digi`, `wx`, `home`, `portable` |

### What an event is

`kind:`, scoped to the packet type it appears in.

| Packet | Values |
|---|---|
| `sos` | `medical`, `trapped`, `lost`, `fire`, `water`, `cold`, `assault`, `vehicle`, `other` |
| `warning` | `fire`, `flood`, `storm`, `wind`, `snow`, `ice`, `quake`, `tsunami`, `landslide`, `chemical`, `radiation`, `outage`, `road`, `crowd`, `animal`, `other` |
| `info` | `traffic`, `stopped`, `slow`, `works`, `closure`, `rain`, `snow`, `ice`, `fog`, `wind`, `debris`, `animal`, `crowd`, `event`, `other` |

`sev:`, on a `warning` only:

| `sev:` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `watch` | may affect you, be ready |
| `warning` | will affect you, act now |
| `danger` | life-threatening, leave |

### Content warnings

`cw:`, one or more words separated by commas.

| Word | Contents |
|---|---|
| `adult` | sexual content |
| `nudity` | nudity that is not sexual |
| `violence` | violence |
| `injury` | graphic injury, blood, surgery |
| `death` | death, human or animal |
| `drugs` | drug or alcohol use |
| `language` | profanity |
| `spoiler` | spoils something the reader may not have seen |
| `flashing` | rapid flashing or strobing |
| `other` | something else the sender thinks needs a warning |

Repeated on every part, covers any `file:`, stays in cleartext when the body is
sealed, never stripped by a relay. Absence is not a guarantee.

### Prices

```
120EUR        firm          ~120EUR       negotiable
25EUR/day     per day       ~25EUR/day    negotiable, per day
offers        make one      swap          wants a trade
free          nothing       (absent)      not stated
```

Currency is an ISO 4217 code, three uppercase letters, never a symbol. Periods:
`h`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`.

### Channels

`t:channel`, one packet per frequency. `power:` present means the station
transmits there; absent means it only listens.

```
kind:    listen simplex repeater beacon net gateway emergency other
mode:    fm am usb lsb cw ssb packet aprs lora ft8 psk31 rtty dmr dstar c4fm m17 dv other
site:    fixed mobile portable temporary
supply:  grid solar wind hydro battery generator fuel mixed
```

Recurring windows: `every:` between them, `for:` how long each lasts, `at:` the
UTC time of day the cycle is anchored to, default `00:00:00`. The 3-3-3 plan is
`ch:3 every:3h for:3min`. `since:` and `until:` bound the schedule itself.

`freq:` is what you tune to hear the station. A repeater's input is `shift:` as
an offset or `input:` outright, the latter for cross-band.

A `t:channel` WITH `d:` is a working-channel invitation (section 23.7): meet
me there -- `until:` how long I wait, `r:` the exchange it serves, `link:` +
`ch:` when the place is a technology (wifi, espnow) rather than a frequency.
Signed or ignored. Choreography: accept with `s:ack` on the commons (or
`s:no`, reason in `m:`) -> both tune -> the invitee RE-AIRS its acceptance on
the working channel ("I am also here") -> only then does the bulk sender
transmit -> done or `until:`, everyone returns to the calling channel. Groups:
`d:` a group name, accept individually, arrive individually.

`range:` is the operator's estimate, not a guarantee.

### Carrying toward a place

`dest:` where it is bound, `near:` how close counts as arrived, `until:` when to
stop (required, never more than a year out), `urg:` `low` `normal` `high`
`urgent`. A carrier takes a copy only if it expects to get closer. Not bound by
the three-relay limit.

`lang:` names the language of `m:`, default English: `PT`, or `PT/BR` for a
regional variant.

`nick:` is a signed, human-readable name on `t:identity`. Shown only when the
signature verifies, newest `ts:` wins, and never usable as an address.

### Commands

`t:command` with `cmd:` and `arg:`; `t:result` with `code:` naming it in `r:`.

```
200 done   202 accepted   400 bad args   403 refused
404 unknown   408 too old   500 failed
```

Answer at once with 202 even when the work takes minutes; any number of results
may name one command. Splits across parts like a message; `cmd:interpret` puts a
natural-language instruction in `m:` for a station that reads it, and a reply
names the reassembled packet rather than any part. Must be signed, expires
after 300 s unless `until:` says otherwise, never carried, never shown as a
message. Authentication is not authorisation -- the allow-list is the bot's.

`cmd:set` makes a device state true (section 25.7): `state:` from the closed
list `on off open closed locked unlocked` (`motion clear pressed` are report
only), `level:` for the partial degree, `target:` for a setpoint. The result
echoes what IS. Unsigned is discarded; signed and unknown is `403`.

A station is owned (section 25.9): unowned, it asks `q:owner` on local
bearers and the first uncarried signed `cmd:set owner:` claims it; the owner
sets `owner:` (the allow-list), `use:` (`all listed owners none`, who may
originate through it), `first:` (who is aired first) and `serve:`; anyone asks
`q:policy`. Send order is fixed: `sos`/`warning`, then `first:`, then `urg:`,
then `ts:`. A policy `ts:` not later than the last accepted one is `408`.

`t:service` advertises what a station does: `relay` `archive` `internet`
`aprs` `nostr` `files` `devices` `time` `weather` `wifi` `other`.
Physical goods are `t:offer`, not this. A claim about capability, never
evidence of good faith. `devices` means the station is a controller: each
automated device it operates is an `X4` station with its own keypair, held
and signed for by the controller (section 25.7.1).

`t:mailbox` names the stations that hold mail for the sender, `hold:` in order
of preference. Several coexist, each optionally bounded by `since:` and
`until:`; the narrowest window containing the moment wins. Cancel one with `r:`
and `remove:mailbox`. All of it must be signed, and an unverifiable one
ignored.

`scope:` limits where a packet goes: absent or `global` anywhere, `local` only
on BLE, WiFi Direct, WiFi Aware and a LAN, or ISO country codes. Not carried
when `local`, and binding on gateways. Reception is never restricted, only
relaying. A group is an address, not a boundary -- only `x:` keeps content
private.

### Catching up, and fetching

```
t:command f:X1BOA3 d:X3RLY7 ts:... cmd:history since:... sig:...
t:command f:X1BOA3 d:X3RLY7 ts:... cmd:history since:... until:... only:X5A3F2 sig:...
t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:... cmd:file file:nYxKz...M1w.jpg sig:...
t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:... cmd:file file:nYxKz...M1w.jpg off:64kB sig:...
t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3RLY7 ts:... cmd:put file:nYxKz...M1w.jpg size:2MB until:... sig:...
```

Standard commands carry parameters in named keys, never `arg:`. The station
answers `code:202`, re-airs the **original packets unchanged**, then `code:200`.
`206` instead means that was one page and more exists: the replay runs **newest
first**, so continue by moving `until:` to the oldest `ts:` you received and
asking again. No cursor, no session. `404` nothing held, `403` refused, `429`
over budget with alternatives in `m:`.
Derived identifiers make the replay safe: a duplicate collapses on the
identifier it already had, so there are no cursors and overlapping windows cost
only airtime.

**A continuation must make progress.** Two rules, one on each side, because
this is the exchange that silently loops when either is missing:

- The station answering MUST serve records strictly OLDER than `until:`, so the
  window a continuation asks for is always a window it has not already served.
- The station asking MUST notice when it stops moving. If a continuation comes
  back reaching the same oldest `ts:` as the one before it, the exchange has
  stalled: that is not new traffic and must not be counted as any (36.10.2), and
  the asker abandons the window rather than asking a third time.

Measured, because both halves failed at once: a resume mark that walked FORWARD
with the clock (each continuation asking for a slightly newer slice than the
last), and then, once that was fixed, one that stopped moving at all. A caller
that reads a stuck loop as a busy archiver polls it at its fastest cadence
forever, which is the most expensive possible response to an archiver that is
telling it nothing.
 Advertise a spool with `serve:archive`, files with `serve:files`.

### Mentions, threads and files

A mention is `@CALLSIGN` **inside `m:`** -- no key. `@` then uppercase letters,
digits, `-` and `/`, ending at the first character that is not one; uppercase is
why `me@example.com` is not a mention. No limit but the packet limit. Being
named raises a notification and is the strongest signal for what to keep.
Anyone may mention anyone, so a client must offer to mute.

`root:` names the packet a thread hangs from. A first-level reply carries `r:`
alone; deeper replies carry both, so a lost middle packet no longer orphans
everything beneath it.

`t:file` says what a file is: `file:` the hash (43 base64url characters, a
dot, the type), `size:` with its unit, `tag:` topics, `m:` the description,
optionally `name:` the filename and `ph:` the piece list's own hash. `size:`
is what lets a station decline before starting a fetch it cannot finish, and
the description is the only thing that makes a file findable by words rather
than by hash.

Files, the whole flow (section 6.7): a listing file (`XFL1`, one `ref size
name` line per file, sorted by name) is a folder; announce it with `t:file
kind:folder count: size:`; fetch anything with `cmd:file` (resume with
`off:`), find holders with `q:have` (`have:full`, a bitfield, or `412/900`),
deposit with `cmd:put file: size: [until:]` and the signed `code:200` is the
custody receipt. A file up to 896 bytes rides inline in `b:` over section 6.6
parts, joined with nothing. Piece lists (`sha size` per line, piece order)
let partial holders serve what they verified. The BitTorrent infohash is
derived deterministically and never needs transmitting between stations.

Archivers (section 36.9): content only from chosen depositors, NEVER from
another archiver. Between archivers only the directory travels -- an `XDIR1`
listing, one `call ts` line per archived callsign, announced with
`t:service serve:archive count: file:<ref>.xdir` and fetched like any file. A
miss answers `code:404 m:try <peers>`. Discovery: `serve:archive` on the air,
or another archiver's verbatim copy of the signed announcement.

### The radio itself

```
t:observation f:X3RLY7 ts:... link:lora busy:41% txtime:6% hears:X1QZ3N,X32DVA
```

**`link:` names the bearer and is required** -- `lora` `ble` `wifi` `espnow`
`halow` `lan` `internet` `vhf` `uhf` `hf` `cb` `pmr` `satellite` `other` --
because a station
here is not one radio on one channel, and a figure averaged across LoRa and a
LAN is not a quantity. A reading without it is discarded; report once per
bearer.

`busy:` how much of the last hour that bearer was occupied by anybody, `txtime:`
how much of it was **this** station, `hears:` callsigns heard **directly** on
it, most relevant first (the sender decides what relevant means), `peers:` how
many are reachable in total so a truncated list is honest. Window is one hour
and is never on the wire, so numbers compare. Keys on `t:observation`, never a
new type -- design rule 5.

`busy:` is what section 31 was missing: a duty cycle limits one transmitter and
says nothing about the forty others already on that bearer. Rising `busy:` means
slow down what is discretionary -- beacons, statuses, history replays -- and let
`urg:` decide what survives. A station reporting `busy:60%` with
`txtime:45%` has found the problem and it is itself.

`hears:` says why a mesh is broken, who to route through, and who is worth
naming in `hold:`. Hearing is often asymmetric -- two stations listing each
other can reach each other; one listing the other cannot.

### Reporting

```
t:report f:X32DVA d:X5A3F2 ts:... r:399227 kind:spam sig:...
```

`kind:` is `spam` `abuse` `illegal` `false` `other`. Must be signed. A report is
a **claim, never a verdict** -- nothing acts on it automatically, and `hide:`
(section 26.3) remains the only packet that hides anything. Mass false reporting
is the obvious attack, so a report is worth its signer's standing and no more.
Reporting is not blocking: muting is local, needs no packet and tells nobody.

### Polls, and passing things on

```
t:poll f:X1QZ3N d:LISBOA ts:... opt:sagres,lagos,portimao until:... m:where shall we meet?
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:7a9b50 vote:sagres
t:reaction f:X32DVA d:LISBOA r:7a9b50 remove:vote
```

`opt:` is two to six labels. **`until:` is required** -- a poll without it is
not counted, because a poll that never closes has a different answer every time
anybody replays it. Narrow the audience with `d:` (a group), `scope:` (`local`
or country codes), `pos:` with `rad:`, or `lang:`; those say who is being
**asked**, never who may answer, and a counter usually cannot check `rad:` at
all because a vote carries no position.

A vote is a reaction, so it is one per callsign,
idempotent and withdrawable; voting again replaces the earlier vote. The count
is **local and provisional** -- every station counts what it heard, the
author's tally is not authoritative, and a client that shows "7 votes" where it
means "7 that reached me" has lied by rounding. **Not a secret ballot**: who
voted for what is public and permanent.

Reply is `r:`. A **quote** is a reply that carries `m:` -- no separate
mechanism. A **repost** is `add:repost` / `remove:repost` on a reaction, and
what travels is the original packet with `f:`, `ts:` and `sig:` untouched, so
duplicates collapse on the identifier and a post reposted by nine stations is
still one post. A repost adds nothing and so cannot misrepresent; a quote is
your own packet with your own words.

### Places

`t:place` reports something that is not you and does not move. `kind:` from:

```
anchorage mooring ramp jetty beach fuel water repair
shelter hut camp spring ford pass summit trailhead other
```

`pos:` where, `title:` names it and a later place with the same title from the
same station replaces it, `until:` for temporary, `file:` for a photograph,
`remove:place` to withdraw. Newest wins per signer; a client shows who said it.
A hazard is `t:warning` and a call for help is `t:sos` -- both carry a relay
budget a place does not.

### Airtime

Unsolicited traffic is bound by the **strictest bearer** a station transmits on,
not the loosest. A beacon is not free; a retry is not a new packet. Serving
yourself is unmetered, serving a stranger is optional, metered and bounded per
period (section 18.4's precedent). Refuse out loud with `code:429` and name
somebody else -- silence and refusal look identical to the asker and mean
opposite things.

**Retention is the station's own** -- this format sets no period, no minimum and
no eviction order. A spool is not a time window: a station may keep a followed
callsign for a year and a stranger for an afternoon, so it advertises
`serve:archive` and never a depth. Answer `code:404` for a window you no longer
hold. A client assumes no depth: ask, take what arrives, ask somebody else for
the rest.

### Status

`t:status` is a short post about the sender, now -- the townhall packet. No
`title:` and it never replaces an earlier one, which is what separates it from
`t:blog`. `d:` absent publishes to anyone in range; `d:` on a group makes it
that group's timeline. Three relays, never carried, replies and reactions both.
Following is a list on the client and never a packet.

`mood:` is optional and one word from this list, for theming only:

```
general   blessed grateful happy sad tired lonely proud worried calm determined
sea       becalmed adrift anchored seasick salty stormbound landsick soaked
          homebound windblown
mountain  summited breathless snowbound frostbitten footsore exposed sheltered
          benighted acclimatised whiteout
```

An unrecognised mood is skipped and the post shown plainly. A mood never earns a
relay, a priority or a notification -- `urg:` speaks to the network and `sev:`
to danger. For a mood this list does not have, `zmood:` is private by section
4.9.

### Closed groups

A group holds a keypair and is addressed by the `X5` callsign derived from it.
The admin holds that key; handing it over is the whole of succession. The group
announces itself with `t:identity` and names itself with `nick:`.

```
t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:... grant:X1RD89,X32DVA sig:...
t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:... grant:X32DVA role:mod until:... sig:...
t:moderate f:X32DVA d:X5A3F2 ts:... revoke:X1PZ4Q until:... sig:...
t:moderate f:X32DVA d:X5A3F2 ts:... r:89a9c8 hide:message sig:...
t:moderate f:X5A3F2 d:X5A3F2 ts:... revoke:X32DVA since:... sig:...
```

A subgroup is an ordinary closed group with its own key, listed by another with
`grant:<X5> role:sub` and delisted with `revoke:`. Listing confers no authority
inside it and membership does not travel down. Five levels counting the root; a
listing that makes a cycle is ignored.

`f:` signs, `d:` names the group. `revoke:` with `until:` is a suspension;
`revoke:` with `since:` voids that moderator's acts from then. Only the admin
appoints; a moderator may revoke and hide. Authority is judged at the act's
`ts:`; newest per signer wins, identifier breaks a tie, a future `ts:` is
discarded. `until:` on a grant is optional, revocations are kept. Asking to join
is an ordinary message -- there is no join packet.

**Never filter `sos`, `warning`, `info` or replies to them.** A client that
cannot verify shows everything and marks the group unverified. Closed is not
private: the roster and the whole moderation history are public, permanent and
gatewayed, which is more exposure than an open group, not less.

### Licensed spectrum

| | Licence-free and internet | Licensed spectrum |
|---|---|---|
| `f:` | any, self-generated `X1`-`X5` included | only a callsign issued to that operator |
| `sig:` | permitted | permitted |
| `x:` | permitted, default on direct messages | never on amateur bands |
| `t:challenge` | works | cannot: it seals a nonce |

**A self-generated callsign never goes on a licensed frequency**, and a gateway
must drop such packets rather than relay them under its operator's licence.
Announce an issued callsign with `t:identity` under that callsign to bind it to
a key; the signature proves key possession, and entitlement is checked against
the authority's register, never in a packet. Signing is lawful on amateur bands
because a detached signature leaves `m:` in clear; sealing is not.

`near:` is not `rad:`. `rad:` is the area a subject occupies; `near:` is how
close to `dest:` is close enough. A warning carried to a town uses both.

`dest:` with no `d:` delivers to a region rather than a person; nothing is
acknowledged.

Two copies by different routes share one identifier, so the recipient sees the
message once and keeps both `via:` lists as routes that work.

Seal the body with `x:` and leave the routing keys in cleartext. Coarsen
`dest:` -- it geolocates your correspondent.

`q:sign` asks for a signed receipt; it copies the arrival `via:` into `route:`
and signs it. `s:sign` without a valid `sig:` is discarded.

`sig:` goes on every packet by default, 65 bytes. Drop optional fields before
dropping the signature. Not signed: `challenge`, `response`.

### Identifiers

Never transmitted. Both ends compute
`sha256(the packet, with sig: and via: removed)` and take the first 6
hexadecimal characters. `r:` carries an identifier
when referring to another packet, including the sender's own when withdrawing
it. Signing and relaying do not change it, which is why those two fields come
out before hashing.

### Limits

| Thing | Limit |
|---|---|
| packet, every transport | 250 bytes |
| parts in one message or post | 9, `n:1/9` to `n:9/9` |
| titled post, inline | about 1650 characters |
| relays, `sos` and `warning` | 9 |
| relays, everything else | 3 |
| incomplete set of parts held | 10 minutes |
| challenge answered within | 60 seconds |
| group name | 1 to 16 characters, uppercase |
| callsign | any length, uppercase |

### Private use

Keys, and `q:` and `s:` words, beginning with `z` are never assigned by this
document.

# Part XI. Archives and implementation

Where published packets live on: the archivers a station chooses,
federated by directories rather than by copying each other. And what of
all this is implemented today.

## 36. Publishing, and the archivers you choose

APRS-IS is a server you connect to. Everything you send becomes everyone's,
everywhere, and everything anyone sends comes back at you as a firehose you
filter locally. It works, it has worked for decades, and it has one centre.

This section describes the same service without the centre: **a station keeps
its own publications and hands them to the archivers its operator chose.** No
station is obliged to have an archiver, and no archiver sees traffic from a
station that did not pick it.

**Every station is an archiver at its own scale.** The role is one role --
keep packets, answer for them, hold mail -- and only the scale is a choice.
A phone in a pocket archives its operator's own words and the words of the
callsigns they follow, and announces nothing. A powered station on a roof --
the ESP32 boards are the working example -- archives everything it hears,
carries mail, bridges bearers, and announces `serve:archive` so others can
lean on it. Between the two is every intermediate an operator cares to
configure; the grammar is the same at both ends.

### 36.0 One role, and it does not change with the bearer

**One role, one word.** `serve:archive` covers everything an archiver does:
keeping packets and answering for them (sections 36.1 to 36.6), holding mail
for stations that are not here (section 36.7) and saying how much it holds
(sections 10.6.5 and 13.12.3), delivering that mail when the recipient turns
up (sections 36.8.1 and 36.8.2), and publishing the directory of who keeps
what (section 36.9). There is no second service word for the pointer
half and no third for the storage half. A station that keeps only pointers and
a station that keeps every byte it hears announce the same `serve:archive` and
differ in what they answer, not in what they are -- which is the only
distinction a reader can act on anyway, because it finds out by asking.

An operator's interface may still present the offers separately, and should:
holding somebody's files and remembering where their files are cost very
different things, and either may be granted without the other. That is a
question of consent, and it stops at the edge of the device. On the air, one
word.

**The role does not change with the bearer.** A `cmd:history` that arrives
over Bluetooth, over a local network, over ESP-NOW, over LoRa or over the
internet is answered the same way: the same records for the same window, the
same `code:202` / `code:200` / `code:206` / `code:404` / `code:429`, the same
paging, the same budgets (section 31.2), the same signatures. A bearer decides
how bytes travel. It never decides what a station will do for you, and an
archiver that behaves differently on one is not a faster or slower archiver, it
is a broken one.

This is written down because getting it wrong is invisible. An implementation
that answers on one bearer only still beacons `serve:archive`, still archives
everything it hears, and still asks its own questions correctly on every
bearer it has -- so it looks healthy from the inside, and its logs record no
error, because nothing was refused. Every asker on any other bearer simply
hears silence. The answer was composed, signed, and put on a radio nobody in
the conversation was listening to.

**Announcing is not addressing.** `serve:archive` heard on one bearer is an
offer on all of them. A reader that hears the announcement over the LAN and
asks over LoRa is owed the same answer, and an archiver may not treat the
bearer an announcement was heard on as the bearer it serves.

**The one place a bearer legitimately decides anything** is choosing among
several paths to the SAME station. An archiver with more than one way to reach
its asker picks one: the path with the highest usable bandwidth among those it
has recent evidence are working, because the whole answer arrives soonest and
a page interrupted halfway is a page asked for again. Reliability outranks raw
speed -- a fast path that has not carried anything lately is a guess, and a
slower one that answered a minute ago is knowledge.

Which makes the bearer an ask ARRIVED on a sound default, and the reason is
worth stating so it is not mistaken for the rule this section rejects: that
bearer just carried a packet from precisely the station now waiting for an
answer, which is the freshest evidence of a working path anyone can have.
Answering there is a path choice made on evidence. What it must not become is
a constraint -- if the archiver knows a better path to that same station, it
uses it, and if the arrival bearer cannot carry the answer it does not give
up.

Where a station cannot tell which path reaches the asker -- the ordinary case
on a broadcast bearer, where nobody has a per-peer path at all -- it answers
on every bearer it can transmit on. Duplicates cost airtime and nothing else:
a replayed packet deduplicates on the section 5 identifier, so the reader sees
one copy however many arrived. On an expensive bearer that cost is real, and
an archiver may hold back a page it has already sent somewhere faster; it may
never hold back the control packets, because a `code:404` or `code:429` that
does not arrive is indistinguishable from a station that is simply not there.

So the failure this section names is narrower than "answered on one bearer",
and worth stating exactly: it is a station that serves on a bearer of its own
choosing rather than one that reaches the asker. That is what makes it
invisible -- the choice is made once, in code, and thereafter every answer
goes out somewhere consistent, plausible, and unrelated to who asked.

**Evidence that a path works is not all the same strength, and a claim must
not silence proof.** A station's `link:` (section 10.6.1) is its own word that
it stands on a radio -- `ble`, `lan`, `lora`. It is the best evidence a local
mesh ever has, and it is a claim, not a measurement: it says the sender is on
that radio, not that you share it. A bearer that carries no `link:` declares
itself through no beacon at all -- the internet path has none, because it is
not a radio a station stands on -- and the only evidence it works is a live
route the transport holds. The two are therefore not interchangeable. Until
`via:` tells a beacon heard on the air from one relayed home (section 37, not
yet implemented), a station on a different network advertises its `link:ble`
into your ear byte-for-byte as though it were in the room, so a path you have
merely been told about must never suppress one you have confirmed. When a
claimed path and a proven one both stand and nothing confirms the claim,
answer on both: the claim costs one packet that deduplicates away, and the
proven path is the one that arrives.

None of this is `scope:local` (section 13.11.1). Scope says how far a packet
may travel and therefore which bearers may carry it, and it constrains the
archiver's answer exactly as it constrains anything else. It is a property of
the packet, decided by its author. What this section forbids is a station
narrowing its own service to one bearer of its own accord.

### 36.1 What a publication is

An archiver holds two different things, and the difference is `d:`.

| | What it is | What the archiver does with it |
|---|---|---|
| **A publication** -- no `d:`, and a type from the list below | offered to whoever is interested | answers queries about it, to anybody |
| **Mail** -- anything carrying `d:` | addressed to one station | holds it for that station and tells them it is there; never offers it to a third party (section 36.7) |

Publication types: `blog`, `passage`, `event`, `offer`, `need`, `place`,
`poll`, `track`, `warning`, `info`, `status`, `channel`, `service`, `file`,
`sos`, `observation`, `identity`.

The last two are what makes a gateway useful to anyone beyond its own hill. A
gateway publishing its OWN `t:observation` is publishing a reachability
record: `f:` says which gateway, `hears:` says which radio-only stations are
at its ear right now, and `ts:` says how fresh that claim is -- the whole
"where can X1BOA3 be reached" question answered by a packet that already
existed. And a gateway passes on the `t:identity` (and `t:mailbox`) packets
of the stations it hears verbatim, which section 36.2 already makes safe:
the author's signature travels with the packet, so an archiver's copy proves
itself against the author's key, not against the gateway's honesty.

Neither published nor held: `ping` and `pong`. They measure whether a path is
alive right now, and a stale one answers a question nobody is still asking.

**Addressing decides, not the type.** A rule that named types would have to be
re-litigated every time a type gains a `d:`, and the packet already says who it
is for. So a `t:message` is mail, a `t:command` to a station that is asleep is
mail, and a `t:warning` with no `d:` is a publication -- which is what each of
them plainly is.

### 36.2 The archiver is sent the packet, not a description of it

An archiver receives the publication **exactly as it was composed and signed**:

```
t:warning f:X3RLY7 pos:39.40,-8.20 rad:5km dest:38.72,-9.14 near:40km urg:urgent kind:fire sev:danger until:2026-08-10_00:00:00 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40
```

150 bytes -- the section 16 example, unchanged, because nothing about publishing
changes a packet. There is no envelope format, no summary record and no
transformation step, which means there is also no second schema to design, keep
in step with the first, and get subtly wrong.

**Why this is affordable, when the file layer's answer was the opposite.** The
DHT stores pointers and never content, because a file is megabytes and a pointer
is 176 bytes. A publication is at most 250 bytes. Pointer and content are the
same order of size, so paying for a pointer *and then* a fetch costs more than
handing over the thing itself. The rule is not "always send pointers"; it is
"send whichever is smaller", and for XPRS that is the packet. The inline file
lane (section 6.7.4) is the same rule applied once more: under ~900 bytes the
content IS the smaller thing, and it rides the packets.

**Everything a query needs is already in it.** `t:` the type, `f:` the author,
`ts:` when it was composed, `pos:` where it is, `dest:` and `near:` the region
it is addressed to, `until:` when it stops mattering, `scope:` how far it may
travel. An archiver answers by reading fields it was handed.

**And the signature travels with it.** An archiver passing on a third party's
publication can neither forge it, retarget it nor resurrect it, and the receiver
verifies against the author's key rather than trusting the archiver that handed
it over. That is what makes gossip between archivers safe, and it is the same
property section 9.1 already gives every signed packet.

### 36.3 You choose your archivers

**A station pushes to the archivers its operator picked, and to no others.**

- The list is configuration: editable, with defaults, and adding or removing an
  archiver is an ordinary act rather than a reinstall.
- **Zero archivers is a valid, working configuration.** Such a station keeps its
  publications and serves them to anyone who asks over the radio (section 36.5).
  It is not findable by somebody who was not listening at the time. That
  is a fair trade and it must remain available: a station that talks only to the
  people in range of it is not a degraded station, it is a private one.
- The choice is **per station, not per operator**. One person's phone may push
  to two archivers while their node in the shed pushes to none.
- An archiver may decline what it is offered. Its disk, its bandwidth, its
  decision -- the same rule section 31.2 states for serving strangers.

The station remembers **what each archiver has already had**, as a position in
its own log rather than a time (section 13 makes the same argument for cursors:
a position cannot skew, and a device with no clock can still persist one). A
reconnect resumes; it does not re-send.

### 36.4 When to push

**When there is a link and it is cheap.** Publishing is not urgent traffic: a
blog post that reaches the index four hours late has lost nothing, and a station
that spends its LoRa duty cycle pushing publications has spent it on the wrong
thing (section 31.1).

So the push belongs to the bearer that is cheap and plentiful -- internet or a
wired link -- and the radio carries publications the way it always did: as
packets, to whoever is listening, once.

### 36.5 Asking a station directly

A station that heard something and wants the rest asks the author, with a verb
that already exists:

```
t:command f:X1BOA3 d:X3RLY7 ts:2026-08-08_14:26:40 cmd:history since:2026-08-04_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

153 bytes (section 25.2). It is already metered by the airtime rules, already
refusable with `code:429`, and already the answer to "I was not here, what did I
miss". Publishing adds no verb of its own.

### 36.6 What replaces the filter

An APRS-IS client subscribes with a filter and receives a stream. Here a reader
**asks an archiver a question** and gets the packets that answer it: by author,
by type, by region and radius, by time window. Every one of those reads a field
the packet already carries, so the query surface needs no vocabulary of its own
and cannot drift from the format it queries.

One reading rule makes the reachability question askable without any new
word: **`only:` matches a callsign wherever the packet carries it** -- as
author, as addressee, or inside a list field (`hears:`, `hold:`, `via:`,
`grant:`). It is a callsign and never a type; section 25.2's `kind:` is the
field that names a type, and the two combine rather than compete. "Everything
about X1BOA3" naturally includes the gateway observations that list it as
heard, which is the answer to "where can X1BOA3 be reached". Worked, against an
archiver:

```
165  t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3IDX1 ts:2026-08-17_14:00:00 cmd:history only:X1BOA3 since:2026-08-17_13:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

The reply is the section 25.2.1 replay -- `code:202`, the original packets,
`code:200` -- and among them:

```
169  t:observation f:X3RLY7 link:lora peers:6 hears:X1BOA3,CT1ABC-9,X5A3F2 uptime:9day ts:2026-08-17_13:59:20 sig:<60 characters>
```

The gateway's own packet, unchanged, signature and all: X1BOA3 was at
X3RLY7's ear forty seconds before the ask. The reader now knows which
internet-connected station is one radio hop from the recipient, and how
stale that knowledge is -- `ts:` is the freshness, and a reader that gets
three gateways back prefers the newest.

A miss is not a dead end: an archiver that does not archive the asked-about
callsign answers `code:404` with `m:try` naming peers whose directories list
it (section 36.9).

The difference that matters is not the syntax. It is that the reader chose the
archiver, the publisher chose the archiver, and neither had to be the same
choice for the network to work.

### 36.7 An archiver is also a mailbox

**The sender is usually gone.** Somebody writes a message on a phone, the phone
is put in a pocket, the screen goes off and the radio with it. If delivery
depended on that phone still being reachable when the recipient next wakes up,
most messages between people who are not simultaneously awake would never
arrive. Store-and-forward exists for this case (section 13.3), and an
archiver is the best carrier on the network for it: always on, addressable, and
chosen deliberately.

So **mail is handed to an archiver too**, and the archiver tells the recipient
there is something waiting. An archiver is therefore a natural entry in a
station's `hold:` list (section 13.12) -- that mechanism already exists and
needs nothing added.

**Privacy is the content's problem, and the format already solved it.** Seal the
body with `x:` (section 9.2) and the archiver stores something it cannot read:

```
t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1RD89 ts:2026-08-13_10:14:00 x:pQ4m9xT2vB8kR until:2026-08-20_00:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

157 bytes. **Be clear about what that does and does not hide.** `t:`, `f:`, `d:`
and `ts:` stay in cleartext, because a station that cannot see who a packet is
for cannot deliver it. The archiver therefore learns that X1QZ3N wrote to X1RD89
at that minute, and how often the two of them do that -- and so did every
APRS-IS server, for every message, in full. Encryption protects the contents;
choosing your archiver is what protects the pattern.

**It is a hold, not an archive.** `until:` bounds it, and the archiver releases
its copy the moment it hears a receipt whose signature it has verified -- the
rule section 7 already states for every carrier, and the reason section 13.7.1
insists a receipt be signed: an unsigned one would let a stranger delete other
people's undelivered mail from every archiver holding it.

An archiver may refuse to carry mail at all, or carry it only for
stations it knows. Its disk, its bandwidth, its decision (section 31.2).

### 36.8 The gateway is the last mile

Sections 36.1 and 36.6 built the outbound half: the gateway told the archiver
who it hears, and a sender found the gateway. This section is the return leg
-- how mail deposited at an archiver reaches a station that has never touched
the internet and never will.

Section 36.7
says mail is never offered to a third party, and a gateway asking for
somebody else's mail IS a third party. Section 13.12 solves it only for
stations that declared a mailbox -- and a solar tracker on a ridge has had no
way to declare anything to an archiver it cannot reach.

The resolution splits on what the mail is:

- **Sealed mail travels on the strength of the seal.** A packet whose body is
  `x:` (section 9.2) is ciphertext to everyone but the recipient; carrying it
  is what custody already is (section 13.6), and handing it to one more
  carrier discloses nothing the airwaves would not. An archiver releases
  sealed mail to a station whose own published observation currently lists
  the recipient in `hears:` -- the gateway one radio hop from delivering. A
  false `hears:` buys an attacker a copy of ciphertext and the envelope
  metadata the archiver already held, which section 36.7 already priced.
- **Clear mail is released only to a declared holder** (`hold:`, section
  13.12) or fetched by the recipient itself. Plaintext is disclosure, and
  disclosure follows the recipient's stated arrangements or nobody's.

The delivery is then ordinary. The sender seals and deposits:

```
162  t:message f:X1QZ3N d:X1BOA3 ts:2026-08-17_14:02:00 x:pQ4m9xT2vB8kRZ7cW0yLuJ3gRhN8sEiDoQ6vXaB1MnYw sig:<60 characters>
```

The gateway X3RLY7, whose observation listed X1BOA3, collects it, airs it on
the radio under the custody rules of section 13, and the receipt comes back
the same path:

```
130  t:receipt f:X1BOA3 d:X1QZ3N r:b47210 ts:2026-08-17_14:19:12 s:ack sig:<60 characters>
```

The receipt is signed by the recipient, so the archiver verifies it and
releases its held copy (section 36.7), the gateway archives its own, and the
sender -- three networks away -- knows the tracker on the ridge has the
message. The gateway was trusted with nothing but ciphertext and effort:
an iGate useful for what it hears and carries, with no need to read what
it moves.

### 36.8.1 The return leg, automated

Section 36.8 built the last mile by hand: somebody had to ask. This section
removes the hand. Two behaviours, one MUST and one MAY, and together they are
what makes a deposited message ARRIVE rather than wait to be collected.

**A station holding mail for X delivers it the moment it hears X.** Directly
(section 10.6.3's sense -- no `via:`), on any bearer; the attempt goes out on
the bearer X was heard on, which is the freshest possible evidence of a
working path (section 36.0). This is not a poll and must not be built as one:
the trigger is the packet from X itself, because a station that checks every
ten seconds spends its battery asking a question the air already answered.
Retries of an unacknowledged copy back off -- that is the same packet aired
again, and not to be confused with handing over the NEXT ones, which section
36.8.2 says should be prompt. A verified `t:receipt` (section 13.7.1) ends
them and releases the held copy -- and every OTHER holder that hears the receipt
releases its copy too, which is how a chain of custodians drains instead of
delivering twice. Airtime spent on delivery attempts is metered under
section 31 like everything else.

**A station holding mail for X may hand it toward where X actually is.**
The choice of where, in order:

1. X's own declaration (section 13.12) -- the recipient's word beats every
   observation. This is the first time `hold:`'s preference order is
   consumed rather than merely stored, and it is consulted first.
2. The gateway whose gossip entry for X is freshest (section 36.9.4) --
   a station that heard X five minutes ago on LoRa is one hop from
   delivering, whatever continent this holder is on.

The hand-off is CUSTODY (section 13.3), not archiver-to-archiver content
sync -- the author's packet travels byte for byte with the author's
signature, `via:` gains the holder's callsign, the section 13.1 budget and
the section 13.2 loop check apply, and section 36.8's disclosure rule
stands: sealed mail moves on the strength of its seal; clear mail moves
only toward a declared holder or the recipient itself. **Once per holder**:
a station forwards a given packet one time, and a forward that comes back
(the `via:` list says so) is not forwarded again. What this buys over
waiting: the mail migrates toward the recipient's radio horizon while both
parties sleep, which is the whole difference between a mailbox and a pile.

### 36.8.2 Draining a backlog, and what a holder must remember

Section 36.8.1 releases mail when the recipient is heard. A station that has
been away has more than one message waiting, and the two obvious readings of
"delivers it" are both wrong: airing everything at once spends the channel a
returning station is trying to use, and airing one and waiting for the next
sighting takes as many sightings as there are messages.

**A release is a page.** The holder hands over the newest few, and the rest
wait for the next sighting -- which is usually seconds away, because a station
that just spoke is about to speak again. What a page is worth is the holder's
budget (section 31), not this document's business; what matters is that the
holder REMEMBERS where the page stopped, so the next one continues instead of
repeating. A holder that always answers with the newest four delivers the same
four for ever, and the recipient never sees the fifth.

**A short page ends the round.** When the holder reaches the end of what it
has, it forgets the mark and the next sighting starts at the newest again --
which is also how mail that arrived while the backlog drained gets its turn.

**Two different waits, and confusing them is the bug.** Backing off applies to
a delivery that was not acknowledged: the same packet, aired again, less often
each time, because the recipient is not answering. Continuing a backlog is not
that -- it is the NEXT packets, to a station that is demonstrably there -- and
it should be prompt. A holder that applies its retry backoff to the backlog
turns a returning station's mail into an afternoon of trickle.

**An acknowledgement is durable or it is worthless.** A receipt releases the
copy (13.7.1), and a holder that forgets the release when its power blinks
re-airs mail the recipient already took -- at the next sighting, and at every
sighting after that, because the archive survived the reboot and the memory of
the receipt did not. A holder that keeps mail across a restart must keep the
receipts across it too.

**And the recipient may ask instead of waiting.** `q:mail` (section 13.12.3)
says how much is held without moving any of it, so a station that comes back
into range can tell in one packet whether waiting is worth it -- and the
holder's `mail:` count (section 10.6.5) says the same thing to everybody in
earshot without being asked.

### 36.9 Archivers among themselves

**An archiver never accepts content from another archiver.** This rule keeps
a federation of archives from becoming one pool of spam. A peer's archive is
that peer's admission decisions -- which callsigns its operator chose to keep,
under which quotas -- and bulk-importing it imports every decision the other
operator got wrong, at zero cost to whoever got them made. Content enters an
archiver exactly one way: section 36.3, from the callsigns its operator chose
or agreed to receive. (The gateway pass-through of section 36.1 is the same
rule, not an exception -- the gateway is a depositor this archiver accepted.)

What archivers DO exchange is a **directory**: which callsigns each one is
archiving or receiving from, and the most recent time it heard from each. A
text listing in the section 6.7.2 family:

```
XDIR1
CT1ABC-9 2026-08-17_13:40:11
X1BOA3 2026-08-17_14:02:36
X1QZ3N 2026-08-17_14:05:02
```

One line per callsign, `call` then `ts` -- two value types this document
already has -- sorted by callsign. The directory is an ordinary
content-addressed file: named in its archiver's signed service announcement,
fetched with `cmd:file`, verified against its reference like anything else.

```
184  t:service f:X3ARC1 serve:archive count:212 file:qA7dTf2mWx9bK4pZcV0yLuJ3gRhN8sE5iDoQ6vXaB1M.xdir ts:2026-08-17_15:00:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

`count:` on the announcement stays what section 24.0.1 made it -- records held,
never callsigns; how many callsigns the directory lists is learned by fetching
the directory. The economics are section 36.2's, applied between archivers: a
line costs about 28 bytes, ten thousand callsigns cost about 280 kB, and an
UNCHANGED directory has an unchanged hash -- so polling a quiet peer costs a
`q:have`-sized question and moves nothing. What a consumer stores is pointers
-- callsign, which archiver, how fresh -- never the content behind them, which
stays where its operator admitted it.

A false directory line is priced like a false `hears:` (section 10.6.3): it
buys its author one wasted redirect per reader and nothing else, because the
content a reader is redirected to still answers or fails on its own
signatures.

**Discovery needs nothing new.** A station finds an archiver four ways:
`serve:archive` heard in a beacon or a `t:service` on the air; another
archiver's copy of that same signed announcement -- `service` is already a
publication type, and section 36.2 makes passing it on verbatim safe; asking
any archiver already found for the announcements it holds -- `cmd:history
kind:service` replays every `t:service` in its spool, which turns one known
archiver into a directory of the services around it; and the redirect, which
is how the federation answers a miss:

```
152  t:result f:X3ARC1 d:X1QZ3N ts:2026-08-17_15:04:10 r:5fd021 code:404 sig:<60 characters> m:try X3ARC2,X3ARC7
```

An archiver asked about a callsign it does not archive says so plainly and
names, in `m:try`, the peers whose directories list it -- the alternates
section 25.2.1 defined for `429`, extended to the miss. The reader asks the
named peer directly; the first archiver never proxies, because proxying is
how content crosses the line this section drew.

The result is a federation of small archives, each vouching only for what
its operator chose to keep, joined by directories that say who keeps what.
No archiver holds the whole network, and any archiver can point across it.

### 36.9.1 What crosses between archivers

Everything archivers exchange is a **signed original**, verifiable against its
author's key rather than against the peer that handed it over (section 36.2).
Four things cross, and each answers a different question:

| What crosses | The question it answers |
|---|---|
| a `t:service` announcement, verbatim | who offers what -- how an archiver is found at all |
| the directory file (section 36.9) | which callsigns deposit where, and **when each was last heard** |
| the archiver's own `t:observation`, with `hears:` | which stations are physically at its ear right now, and how fresh that claim is |
| `t:mailbox hold:` declarations, verbatim | which stations chose which archiver to hold their mail |

Together the last three ARE the gossip of section 36.9.4 -- reachability,
carried by packets that already existed.

The last three are how the federation answers its three standing questions --
where is X1BOA3 reachable, who archives X1BOA3, where does X1BOA3's mail rest
-- without any archiver vouching for another. Each answer is a packet its
author signed, so a peer relaying it can neither forge nor retarget it, and a
reader weighs its `ts:` for itself.

**What does not cross is the store.** Archivers do not synchronise message
archives with each other -- that is section 36.9's first rule, and the
directory exists precisely so they do not have to. The one temporal fact that
DOES flow is the last-heard timestamp riding each directory line: "X1BOA3,
last heard 2026-08-17_14:02:36" is knowledge worth spreading; the packets
X1BOA3 aired stay where an operator chose to admit them. And mail never
crosses at all: a held message leaves an archiver toward its recipient, a
declared holder, or a `hears:` gateway (sections 36.7, 36.8) -- never toward
a peer archiver as such.

### 36.9.2 The archiver is the seeder

Publications carry `file:` references (section 6.7); the bytes behind a
reference live wherever somebody chose to keep them. For those bytes the
archiver plays the part a seeder plays in a torrent swarm: it holds a full
verified copy, says so when asked, and serves it without involving the
author.

The mechanics already exist, and this section adds none. `q:have` (section
7.1) asks whether the bytes are held and is answered with `have:full`, a
bitfield, or a fraction; `cmd:file` fetches them, `off:` resumes a dead
transfer; `cmd:put` deposits them under a stated `size:` and `until:`; an
`ih:` reference (section 6.7.5) lets the same copy seed a BitTorrent swarm
where one exists. A station doing this announces `serve:files` beside
`serve:archive` -- the words stay separate because a pure file host with no
packet spool is a real station, but on an archiver the two halves reinforce:
the spool holds the announcement that names the file, and the file store
holds the bytes the announcement points to.

Admission follows section 36.3, not the swarm: an archiver seeds what its
depositors published and what its operator pinned, under its own quotas, and
bulk-importing a peer's file store is the same mistake as bulk-importing its
spool. A reader that gets `q:have` answers from several holders fetches from
the best-placed one and verifies against the reference either way -- the
holder vouches for nothing but bandwidth.

The directory file of section 36.9 is itself served this way, which is the
arrangement eating its own cooking: fetching a peer's directory IS a
`cmd:file` against a seeder.

### 36.9.3 Neighbours: redundancy for an area

Most of what a community publishes is about a PLACE -- `info`, `warning`,
`event`, `status`, `blog`, and the undirected `message` traffic of a town
channel. A reader asks whichever archiver is reachable, and a neighbourhood
whose only archiver went dark loses its own noticeboard. So two archivers
that are placed near each other MAY keep each other's community publications
alive, deliberately and within bounds:

- **Nearby is declared, then measured.** Both stations carry `pos:` on their
  announcements; each computes the distance itself. The reference threshold
  is 25 km, and an operator tunes it to the terrain -- the point is a shared
  audience, not a number.
- **Opt-in.** Redundancy is an operator's choice, like every other cost in
  this section. Nothing obliges an archiver to mirror its neighbour.
- **Community kinds only.** The standing ask names them:

```
t:command f:X3ARC1 d:X3ARC2 ts:2026-08-20_08:30:00 cmd:history kind:info,warning,event,status,blog,message since:2026-08-20_06:12:44 sig:<60 characters>
```

The mechanism is section 36.10's meeting with a `kind:` filter, on section
36.10.1's per-peer watermark, under section 31.2's budgets -- a standing
catch-up, not a new protocol. The peer re-airs ORIGINALS, each verifying on
its author's own signature, and they enter the asker's store through its own
admission like anything else heard on the air; section 36.9's line is not
crossed, because nothing is imported on the peer's authority. Replayed
packets deduplicate on the section 5 identifier and expire on their own
`until:`, so the two stores converge on the union of both neighbourhoods'
publications for those kinds and nothing else.

Mail takes no part in this. A packet carrying `d:` is section 36.7's business
however it travels, and a neighbourhood replay serves publications --
undirected packets -- by construction.

### 36.9.4 Gossip: who was heard where

The exchanges of this section have a collective name, because implementations
kept building fragments of it without seeing the whole: **gossip**. Archivers
never sync content -- that rule opened this section and stands. What they
gossip is REACHABILITY: which callsign was heard, by which station, on which
bearer, when. Every archiver keeps its own bounded table of it, built from
what it overheard and what its peers passed on, and the network's answer to
"where can X be reached" is the sum of many small tables rather than one
central one. That is the load-bearing difference from APRS-IS, whose central
servers hold the only copy of exactly this knowledge.

Gossip rides packets this document already has -- a signed `t:observation`
with `hears:` (10.6.3), a signed `t:mailbox` (13.12), a `t:service`
announcement (24) -- passed on verbatim under section 36.1's rule. There is
no gossip packet type, because a new envelope for old facts would be a second
schema to drift.

**The three layers.** What is known about a callsign divides by durability,
and the division is what keeps the table small and the routing honest.
Consulted in this order:

| layer | holds | fed by | expires |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1 -- declared** | the callsign's own `hold:` list, in its order | its own signed `t:mailbox` | its own `until:` |
| **L2 -- visit history** | the last K distinct archivers that heard the callsign DIRECTLY on a short-range bearer; per entry: archiver, first heard, last heard | radio truth only (below) | **never** -- the ring evicts the oldest distinct archiver when a new one appears. K is 100 for the reference station classes |
| **L3 -- live sightings** | the freshest (gateway, bearer, time) claims, at most G per callsign (reference G = 8) | any verified sighting, internet included | a TTL (reference 24 hours) -- a sighting is a reading, and section 24.0.1 already said what stale readings are worth |

L1 is the recipient's word and beats everything. L3 answers "deliver NOW".
L2 answers a question neither can: "where does this callsign tend to
surface" -- the marina a boat checks in at, the repeater a commuter passes
-- which is precisely the knowledge that routes a message deposited months
after the last sighting. It is the one layer allowed to live forever,
because it is small (K entries per callsign), slow-moving, and irreplaceable.

**Validity: gossip is a claims market, priced.** Every entry is credited to
the station that SIGNED the packet it came from. Unsigned observations feed
nothing beyond the local air view; forged ones are dropped by the existing
verification. `hears:` keeps its 10.6.3 character -- it informs a route and
never compels one. Then three walls:

- **L2 admits radio truth only**: this archiver's own direct hearing, or a
  verified observation whose `link:` names a short-range bearer. No packet
  that travelled only the internet writes the durable layer -- poisoning
  the visit map requires transmitting on the air somewhere, with a signed
  identity, inside radio range of a station that keeps records.
- **Per-signer quota**: one observer's gossip is accepted at the rate its
  own adverts arrive (section 31's metering applied to ingestion); a signer
  exceeding it is a signer to stop crediting.
- **Byte budget with eviction**: the whole table lives under a cap sized to
  the station class (below), and when full, L3 evicts stalest-first before
  L2 evicts anything.

What spam buys after all three walls is what a false `hears:` always bought
(10.6.3): one wasted redirect per reader, never a delivery -- the mail's own
signatures and receipts decide those.

**The arithmetic, so budgets are designed rather than discovered.** An entry
packs into about 20 bytes (two callsigns at up to seven characters, a
timestamp, a bearer, flags). A full K=100 visit ring is ~2 KB per callsign.
A pocket or desktop node's reference table cap is 5 MB -- room for the
visit history of ~2,500 callsigns, which is a town. Stations below that
class do not try (next paragraph); stations above it raise the cap.

**Need-to-know, not replication.** A station keeps gossip in proportion to
its duties. An ESP32 archiver does not track the active callsigns of a
planet: it keeps the L1 declarations that name it, its own direct-heard
rings, and L2/L3 rows only for callsigns it is currently holding mail for
-- a few kilobytes. Everything else it resolves when a duty arrives, by
asking a bigger archiver -- and that ask is machinery this document already
built: `cmd:history only:X1BOA3 kind:observation` (36.6) replays the signed
sightings the bigger station holds, which the asker verifies and caches
into its own L3. Bulk gossip is the history replay; it needs no new verb.
(The XDIR census file earlier in this section remains the bulk form for a
station that can serve files; a station that cannot omits the `file:`
reference from its announcement and the ask-form above carries the load.)

**Archiver classes, and the super-archiver.** One role -- section 36.0 --
at three scales, and the scale is announced so an asker can pick:

| class | announces | keeps | serves |
|---|---|---|---|
| pocket archiver | `serve:archive` | own log, held mail, need-to-know gossip | section 31 reference budgets |
| station archiver | `serve:archive` | its neighbourhood's spool and visit map | section 31 reference budgets |
| **super-archiver** | `serve:archive,super` | gossip for every active callsign it can learn of, deep spool, no need-to-know cap | orders of magnitude above the reference budgets -- thousands of asks a minute is the design point |

A super-archiver is the role the network cannot do without, and 36.12.2 says
why: on transports nobody owns, stations whose neighbours are all remote are
invisible to each other until one archiver they can all address is holding
the conversation. It is where public traffic is pushed and where it is pulled
from -- not an optimisation of the broadcast, but the mechanism that replaces
it once the broadcast stops crossing.

A super-archiver is a full server wherever always-on storage and reach
live: a machine on the internet, and nothing in this section stops the same
role running on a satellite or a store beyond Earth -- every hop here is
store-and-forward, and store-and-forward does not care how long the light
takes. Humble stations ask super-archivers what their own gossip does not
know, the way 13.12.1 already falls back to `serve:archive`; discovery is
the ordinary service discovery of this section. `super` is a claim like
every other `serve:` word: it invites asks and compels nothing, and a
super-archiver that answers like a pocket one simply stops being asked.

**What claiming `super` commits a station to.** The word is a claim like every
other `serve:` word and compels nothing -- but a station that cannot do the
following should not write it, because every humble node that believes it will
route its asks nowhere:

| the claim | what it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **addressable** | reachable by a DIRECTED packet, not only by broadcast. A station that can only announce is not reachable through a public transport at all (36.12.1), and a super that cannot be asked is not a super |
| **deep** | a spool measured in RECORDS, not in whatever the board's flash happened to have spare. A store that holds a busy neighbourhood's day is a pocket archiver with ambitions |
| **budgeted for it** | section 31.2's reference numbers raised by orders of magnitude, because six replays an hour is a pocket device's budget and a super exists to be leaned on |
| **concurrent** | more than one ask in flight. One replay at a time, with a page taking tens of seconds to air, means the second asker of any minute is refused |
| **complete** | gossip kept for every callsign it learns of, without the need-to-know cap a small station rightly applies (36.9.4) |
| **awake** | always on, because the value of a super is that it heard what everybody else missed while they were asleep |

A station that can do some of these and not others is an ordinary archiver
doing well, which is a good thing to be. `serve:archive` says so honestly.

### 36.10 Two archivers meet

A station that was away has a hole in its archive exactly as wide as its
absence, and the network already has the tool that fills it: `cmd:history`
(section 25.2). What this section adds is only WHEN to use it on the
archiver's own behalf.

**On sighting.** An archiver that hears `serve:archive` from a station it
has not heard for a while -- back in radio range, or just powered on --
asks that station for the window it missed:

```
t:command f:X3ARC1 d:X3ARC2 ts:2026-08-20_08:30:00 cmd:history since:2026-08-20_06:12:44 sig:<60 characters>
```

`since:` is the timestamp of the newest packet the asker held WHEN THE
HOLE BEGAN -- at power-on, the newest already on disk. The live newest is
useless for this: by the time the peer is sighted, fresh traffic has
pushed it past the very window the absence made, and the ask would ask
for nothing. Overlap is harmless -- replayed packets deduplicate on the
section 5 identifier. The peer re-airs its spool for
that window under its own section 31 serving budget, on whichever path
section 36.0 selects -- usually the bearer the ask arrived on, which is the
freshest evidence of a path to the asker, but never that bearer merely because
it is the one the code happens to reach for. The replayed packets are
ORIGINALS: each carries its author's signature and verifies (or fails) on its
own, and each is heard on the air like any other packet -- which is what keeps
section 36.9's line intact. Nothing is imported; the returning station simply
gets to hear what the air said while it was not listening. Both archives
converge on the union of what either heard, deduplicated by the section 5
identifier.

Discipline, so a meeting is not a storm: ask once per peer per absence (a
cooldown of at least ten minutes); do not ask without a synced clock (a
`since:` from a wrong clock asks for the wrong window); and a station with
nothing missing asks for nothing -- an empty reply costs the peer its
budget all the same.

### 36.10.1 The pocket device polls

Section 36.10 is written for stations that notice an absence. A pocket
device cannot: it sleeps in a pocket, wakes on a desk, crosses town, and
has no idea which of those was an absence worth naming. So it does not
track absences at all -- it keeps a WATERMARK and polls.

The watermark is a persisted timestamp PER ARCHIVER: the end of the last window
that archiver answered for. Not one shared mark -- an archiver holding nothing
answers `code:404`, which is an answer and advances the mark, so a shared one
lets an empty peer narrow the window on a full one standing beside it. The
device then never asks the full peer for anything older, and nothing anywhere
reports that it stopped. The poll is the same ask as any meeting:

```
165  t:command f:X1QZ3N d:X3ARC1 ts:2026-08-20_09:30:00 scope:local cmd:history since:2026-08-20_09:20:00 sig:<60 characters>
```

`since:` is the watermark. `scope:local` keeps the ask on the short-range
bearers, which is where a locally-reachable archiver by definition is.

The cycle:

1. Every poll period (default TEN MINUTES), the device looks at the
   stations it has heard DIRECTLY (no `via:`) within the last beacon
   staleness window and picks the ones announcing `serve:archive`.
2. To each, at most one ask per period, it sends `cmd:history since:` the
   watermark. A fresh install has no watermark and asks for nothing; it
   sets the watermark to now and starts keeping.
3. THAT archiver's watermark advances to the ask's own `ts:` when it
   answers `code:200` -- or `code:404` (nothing held is an answer). It does
   NOT advance on `code:429` or on silence, so an unanswered window is simply
   asked for again next period, and it does not advance on `code:206`, which
   closes a page rather than the window (section 25.2.1).
3a. An archiver's `count:` (section 24.0.1) may bring the next ask FORWARD --
   the number moved, so there is something to fetch and the period need not be
   waited out. It may never postpone one indefinitely: the period in step 1 is
   a backstop that is always armed, because a `count:` can be absent on the
   bearer in use, or stale from one no longer in use, and a device that lets a
   frozen number silence its poller stops fetching while continuing to look
   healthy.
4. The window an ask may claim is bounded to seven days. A device that
   was away longer asks for the last week; anything older is fetched
   deliberately, not by a background poll.

Ten minutes is not arbitrary: section 31's reference serving budget
answers a known caller six times an hour, and a ten-minute poll is
exactly that ceiling. It is the period for an ORDINARY archiver, and
36.10.2 is what a station does with it once it can see which of its
archivers are busy and which have been silent since spring. A device polling
faster steals its own budget; a device polling slower merely learns the news
later. Replayed packets deduplicate on the section 5 identifier, so a window
asked twice costs airtime, never correctness.

### 36.10.2 The poll adapts to what it finds

36.10.1 gives every archiver the same clock. That is the right default and
the wrong steady state: a room nobody has spoken in since spring costs the
same metered replay as one with a conversation running, and the station
paying for both is the archiver. A station SHOULD therefore keep a SEPARATE
interval per archiver and move it according to what that archiver answers.

The measurement is free, because the answer is already coming back:

| the archiver answered | the interval |
|---|---|
| a page with records we did not have | halve it -- it is talking |
| `code:206`, more held than served | ask the continuation IMMEDIATELY; a peer that says there is more should not be made to say it again next period |
| `code:200` or `code:404` with nothing new | double it |
| `code:429` | double it, and never faster than once a minute afterwards |
| silence | leave it; silence is evidence about the path, not about the room |

**The ceiling is how long that archiver has been quiet.** Reference values,
counted from the last time it gave this station something new:

| silent for | asked at most every |
|---|---|
| less than a week | 10 minutes (36.10.1's period) |
| a week or more | 60 minutes |
| three months or more | 6 hours |

**The floor is what the peer permits, and it is not the caller's to choose.**
Section 31.2's reference budget answers a known caller six times an hour,
which is the whole reason 36.10.1's period is ten minutes. So:

- An ordinary archiver is never asked faster than that period, however busy
  the room gets. A station that polls one faster does not get more news; it
  spends that archiver's cross-caller allowance, and the callers it starves
  are its own neighbours.
- A **super-archiver** (36.9.4) may be asked far faster, because raised
  budgets are what a super-archiver IS -- reference floor **15 seconds**. Not
  lower, and for a reason that has nothing to do with budgets: one replay
  runs at a time and a page takes on the order of fifteen seconds to air, so
  an ask sent faster than that arrives while the previous answer is still
  being sent and is refused. A station MUST NOT have more than one
  unanswered ask outstanding to the same archiver.
- A station's own other devices (section 3.1) are not metered by the
  responder at all and may be asked at the same fast floor.

**`code:429` is the archiver's authority over the caller's cadence.** It is
the one answer that must always slow a station down. Treating it as silence
-- asking again on the same schedule, being refused again -- is a loop that
never advances a watermark and looks from the outside like a quiet network.

**Nobody awake, nobody polled fast.** A device whose screen is off and whose
operator is not reading anything falls back to the quiet ladder whatever the
room is doing. A fast tier exists to put words on a screen somebody is
looking at; running it into a pocket spends battery and somebody else's
serving budget to no end.

**Spread the herd.** A station SHOULD jitter each interval by a small
fraction (a tenth is enough). Many devices pulling one super-archiver on the
same nominal period arrive together, and the load an archiver actually feels
is the peak, not the average.

Two properties make all of this safe to get wrong. A replayed packet
deduplicates on its section 5 identifier, so an interval that is too short
costs airtime and never correctness; and the watermark only advances on an
answer, so an interval that is too long delays news and never loses it.

### 36.11 When the store is full

An archiver's capacity is whatever its operator gave it, and when the
store is full something must go. Section 31.3 stands: retention belongs to
the station, and nothing here is an obligation. What follows is the
DEFAULT the reference stations ship with, because a default chosen badly
deletes somebody's mail to keep a stranger's chatter. What goes is decided
by class first and age second -- **within a class the oldest goes
first**, and no packet outlives its own `until:`.

Discarded first, kept longest last:

1. **The spool** -- ordinary heard traffic. It is the bulkiest class and
   the cheapest to lose: any peer's spool overlaps it, and section 36.10
   refills holes.
2. **Custody mail** -- store-and-forward held for stations that did NOT
   name this archiver: mail picked up as a favour (section 13.3), and
   packets carried toward another place. Losing it costs a delivery
   somebody else may still make.
3. **Declared mail** -- mail for callsigns whose `t:mailbox hold:` names
   THIS archiver (section 13.12). Those recipients chose this station
   deliberately and check it first; it is the last thing an archiver may
   drop, and inside its `until:` it should never be.

The classes read straight off the packets: `d:` plus a `hold:` declaration
naming this station is class 3, `d:` without one is class 2, everything
else is class 1. An archiver that cannot take new mail without touching
class 3 refuses the mail out loud instead -- `code:429` and, when it can,
`m:try` naming a peer with room (section 31.3).

### 36.12 Reaching a callsign from anywhere

Everything this section built now composes into the sentence APRS operators
have wanted said about a modern network: **a message handed to any archiver,
from anywhere, reaches the callsign it names -- wherever that callsign last
touched a radio.** The pieces, in the order a message meets them:

1. **Deposit.** A sender -- a phone on another continent, a script on a
   server, a station three bearers away -- hands `t:message d:X1BOA3` to
   any archiver it can reach (36.3, 36.7). The archiver holds it: this is
   already mail, already bounded by `until:`, already released by receipt.
2. **Consult.** The holder consults its gossip for X1BOA3 (36.9.4):
   the recipient's own declaration first, the freshest live sighting
   second, the visit history third. A holder whose table has nothing asks
   a super-archiver, exactly as a small station always could.
3. **Forward.** The held wire moves as custody toward the named gateway or
   declared mailbox (36.8.1) -- signed by its author, `via:` growing,
   loop-checked, once per holder. It can cross the internet on one hop and
   a LoRa hill on the next; every hop is a holder, so nothing is lost to a
   link that is down today.
4. **Deliver.** The gateway that actually hears X1BOA3 releases the mail
   the moment it does (36.8.1), on the radio it heard it on. The receipt
   (13.7) walks back through every holder and clears them all.

The APRS-IS comparison, drawn once and plainly. An igate is here any
archiver with a radio -- and unlike an igate it holds mail rather than
forwarding into the void. The central servers are replaced by gossip among
archivers, with super-archivers as the deep memory for whoever wants one --
but no single table anyone must trust, fund, or keep alive. Last-heard
routing is the same idea APRS-IS proved for decades, done here with signed
claims instead of trusted servers. And absence, which loses an APRS message,
merely delays an XPRS one: every hop stores, so the system tolerates a
recipient asleep for a night or a link that is a satellite pass -- the same
property, at the scale of a pocket or of the solar system.

What this section does NOT promise: delivery to a callsign nobody has ever
heard (gossip cannot know it -- though a declaration can pre-position its
mailbox), secrecy of the envelope (36.7 said what stays visible and why),
or that any station carry anything against its own budgets (31.3 stands
everywhere). The promise is narrower and worth having: if the callsign
touches the network anywhere its gossip reaches, the mail finds it.

### 36.12.1 Constrained internet transports

The chain above crosses the internet on shared transports run by strangers
-- community Reticulum hubs, gateways with their own budgets and their own
ideas about what is worth carrying. Operating experience is blunt: **a
shared transport filters, and the subset that reliably crosses is small --
identity announcements and directed messages.** Broadcast wapp data, bulk
announces, anything addressed to nobody in particular may be dropped at any
hop, silently, with no error to read. A design that works only on an
unfiltered transport does not work; this section standardises how every
exchange in 36.8--36.12 rides the lanes that actually cross.

**The two guaranteed lanes.** What a constrained transport carries: (1) an
identity announcement -- the transport's own currency, since without paths
nothing routes; (2) a message directed at a named destination the transport
has a path to. Everything an archiver needs to say across the internet MUST
be expressible as one of those two, and every behaviour below is that rule
applied to one exchange.

**Asks are directed messages.** A station resolving a callsign across the
internet -- the 36.9.4 miss path -- sends its ask as a directed packet to a
NAMED archiver: `cmd:history kind:identity,observation only:X1BOA3` with
`d:` naming a super-archiver it has chosen. It does not broadcast the
question and hope; a broadcast question on a filtered transport is a
question not asked. `kind:` lists `identity` first deliberately: the
observations that answer the question verify against keys the asker may
never have met, and the identities that carry those keys must land first.

**Replies are directed messages too.** A station answering an ask that
arrived over an internet transport MUST send every replayed record and
every `t:result` on the directed lane to the asker, whether or not it also
airs them locally (36.10's radio pacing stands for the local copy). A
replayed record carries its AUTHOR's addressing, not the asker's -- on the
announce lane it is exactly the broadcast a filtered hop drops, and an
asker who got a 202 and then silence was served in every sense but the one
that matters. The double lane costs nothing: both copies carry the same
section 5 identifier, and receivers already deduplicate on it.

**The keys ride the same page.** A page of sightings about X is signed by
the stations that SAW X, not by X and not by the server. The responder
prepends the newest `t:identity` it holds for each observer on the page,
once each, before the observations they vouch for -- a page of claims the
asker cannot verify is a page the asker must discard, and asking the
internet for each key separately is the round trip this section exists to
avoid.

**`only:` matches the subject, not just the correspondents.** For
observation records, `only:X` matches a sighting OF X -- an observation
whose `hears:` lists X -- not merely packets X sent or received. An
observation about X has the observer in `f:` and X only in `hears:`;
matching sender and addressee alone made "the signed sightings this
station holds about X" an empty set by construction. (For every other
record type, `only:` keeps its 36.6 meaning: sender or addressee.)

**No gateway resolved is not a dead end: deposit.** A holder whose gossip
names no gateway for X MUST NOT fall back to broadcasting the mail into a
filtered transport. It fires the miss-path ask (above) and, holding mail it
cannot yet route, MAY deposit the held wire as custody with a
super-archiver -- 36.12 step 1 again, one hop up: the super-archiver's
gossip is the deepest available, and a deposit is a directed message that
crosses. `via:` grows, the loop check applies, once per holder, as 36.8.1
always said.

**A sender is its own first holder.** A station sending `t:message d:X`
parks its own signed wire for custody at the moment of sending, exactly as
it would park a stranger's: an airing is an ATTEMPT, not a delivery, and
the obligation ends at a verified receipt (13.7.1) -- not before. This is
what makes the whole chain start: the sender's own forwarder consults
gossip, asks on a miss, deposits toward a super-archiver, all with the
sender's original bytes and signature.

**A super-archiver keeps the chatter.** Signed observations are the wires
a bulk-gossip replay serves; a super-archiver that discards presence
records answers every `kind:observation` ask with an empty page, whatever
its own gossip table knows -- gossip stores conclusions, and a replay may
only re-air original packets (36.1, 36.2). `serve:archive,super` therefore
implies retaining observation and identity wires under the raised budgets
of 36.9.4, on every lane the internet included: the declaration rule (36.3)
guards MAIL spooled on other people's behalf, and presence is not mail --
on a super-archiver the sightings mostly arrive over the very transport
that rule polices, because the boards that saw them dial in over it.

**And still no inbound ports.** Nothing in this section opens a listener:
every reach across the internet is an outbound dial to a transport, and a
directed message crosses two NATs because the transport routes it, not
because either end is reachable. A deployment instruction that begins
"forward port" has misread this document.

What is deliberately NOT constrained: a transport one operator controls end
to end -- a private hub, a LAN, a point-to-point link -- carries whatever
its operator pleases, and the broadcast forms elsewhere in this document
remain correct there. The rules above are the floor that keeps the chain
working on transports nobody owns; on a better transport they are merely
redundant, and redundancy over two lanes that deduplicate to one record is
the cheapest insurance in this document.

### 36.12.2 Public traffic across the internet: the archiver is the meeting place

36.12 routes mail to ONE callsign. This section is the other half, and it
took a working bench to find: **public traffic -- the broadcast that is
addressed to everybody -- does not cross the internet by being broadcast.**
It crosses because archivers hold it and other stations ask them for it.

The failure is quiet and worth naming, because every part of it reports
success. Two stations on different networks hear each other's announcements
all day. Each publishes a `t:message` with no `d:`, the local bearers report
`sent`, the packet is signed and archived at home -- and neither ever sees a
word the other said. Nothing errors. There is nothing in either log to read.

**Why: a broadcast is an announcement, and shared transports do not
cross-forward announcements between their own clients** (36.12.1). The two
guaranteed lanes are identity announcements and directed messages, and a
public post is neither. So a station whose neighbours are all on the far side
of the internet publishes into silence.

The answer is the archiver, used as both a destination and a source:

**Push what you publish to the archivers you chose.** 36.3 already says a
station pushes to the indexers its operator chose, and 36.4 says when. Across
the internet that push MUST be an addressed copy per chosen archiver -- one
directed message each, which is a lane that crosses -- and not a reliance on
the broadcast having reached them. A wire carrying a `d:` is mail and is
excluded: it has its own custody path (36.7, 36.8.1).

**Pull what everybody else published from the same place.** A station's
catch-up (36.10.1) MUST include its configured archivers, and this is where
implementations go wrong in two specific ways:

- **Asking only stations it can HEAR.** A station in earshot holds what IT
  heard, which is a neighbourhood. Public traffic is not a neighbourhood: it
  is everything everybody said, and only an archiver that collects from many
  stations holds that. An archiver is asked whether or not any radio is up --
  a station with no radio in earshot has MORE need of it, not less.
- **Marking the ask `scope:local`.** A local poll is a reasonable thing to
  scope, and 13.11.3 says a `scope:local` packet is never carried -- so the
  internet bearer refuses it before it leaves, and the archiver on the other
  side of the world is listed, counted, and never actually asked. A catch-up
  ask is DIRECTED: it reaches one named station, that station meters it
  (31.2), and it needs no scope to stay cheap.

**A super-archiver is what makes this work at all** (36.9.4). Somebody
reachable over the internet has to hold everything, or there is nowhere for
the rest to push to and nowhere to pull from. This is the one role the
network cannot do without: stations with only radio neighbours are invisible
to each other until one archiver they can all address is holding the
conversation.

**What an archiver admits off the internet.** 36.3's declaration rule -- a
station archives an internet-borne packet only when its author declared this
station as a mailbox -- guards against spooling other people's MAIL, and mail
is exactly the case that carries a `d:`. It MUST NOT be applied to
publications: a `t:status` (27), a `t:reaction` (6.5) and a `t:message` with
no `d:` are written for everybody by definition, which is what makes them
public in the first place. An archiver that refuses them is refusing to be an
archiver of public traffic, and the room that reaches everyone reaches
nobody.

**Addressing is a prerequisite, and it fails silently.** All of the above is
directed traffic, so it depends on turning a callsign into the transport's
own address. When that lookup fails, an implementation naturally falls back
to broadcasting -- and the fallback is the failure, dressed as a send. Two
rules follow:

- A station SHOULD publish its callsign as its display name on whatever
  identity the transport announces, so a peer that has only ever heard the
  announcement can still address it.
- A resolver MUST read every name the transport offers, not the first one it
  happens to parse. Implementations that resolve address-to-callsign for
  display and callsign-to-address for sending tend to grow the two
  independently; the second is the one that fails silently, so it is the one
  that must be checked against the air.

**A station too small for a link layer still has a directed lane.** "Directed"
in this section means addressed to one destination, not any particular
transport mechanism. A microcontroller with kilobytes of free memory cannot
carry a link layer or a store-and-forward router, and it does not need one: an
addressed, encrypted single packet reaches a named destination through the same
transports, and reference implementations forward it by destination the same
way they forward anything else. Measured across a public hub, multi-hop,
between two stations on different networks.

What it gives up is the receipt. A link tells the sender the peer received it;
a single packet does not, so silence and refusal look alike. That is the right
trade for an ask that will be asked again anyway -- a poll, a gossip query, a
replay request, all of which repeat on their own schedule (36.10.2) -- and the
wrong one for mail, which is why mail is held under custody (36.7) rather than
fired at a destination and forgotten.

So a constrained station's obligations shrink to three: announce so paths
exist, answer where it was asked from, and never assume its packet arrived.

**Send on every lane that might work.** Where a transport offers more than
one addressed mechanism, a directed wire MAY go out on all of them: they fail
independently, and section 5's identifier makes the duplicate collapse into
one record on arrival. Measured on the bench, two phones on different
networks exchanged one addressed form happily while the other stayed silent
between the same two endpoints.

The whole of this section reduces to one sentence: **on a transport nobody
owns, an archiver is not an optimisation of public traffic, it is the
mechanism.**

## 37. Implementation status

| Element | State |
|---|---|
| **On the air** | **implemented** on the Flutter side: the discovery beacon is an XPRS `t:observation` on its own BLE5 subtype `0x58` (`docs/ble5.md`), carrying `peers:`, `hears:` and `mail:`; `MeshCourier` emits XPRS for every carried message, and custody reads it. The **chat wapp emits XPRS too** since 0.4.38 -- 1:1, group, broadcast and position (`wapps/chat/xprs.c`, `docs/aprs-xt.md` section 2.2) -- keeping the compact frame only for its own control frames (`?MAIL`, `?IGATE`, `?PING`) and for a body over 250 bytes. Every receiver still reads both, so an un-ported peer keeps working. The ESP32 T-Dongle (`esp32/rns_ble5`) speaks XPRS too via `esp32/components/geogram_xprs`, a C mirror of `lib/services/xprs/` replaying the same 205-example corpus: it reads both subtypes, parks `t:message` mail by derived identifier, relays with `via:`, answers `t:ping` with `t:pong rssi:` (rate-limited per section 31.2), refuses `scope:local` at custody admission, dates its packets `epoch:` (section 10.7, NVS boot counter) and transmits unsigned |
| **The packet format itself** | **implemented**; `lib/services/xprs/` parses, encodes, derives identifiers and signs. Every example packet in this document is a test fixture: `test/xprs_packet_test.dart` round-trips all 201 byte-exact, checks each stated byte count, and cross-checks every identifier against an independent Python implementation |
| Section 5 identifiers | **implemented** |
| Section 9.1 signatures, and surviving a relay | **implemented**; `test/xprs_sig_test.dart` signs, relays three hops and re-verifies |
| Section 25.9 station ownership and owner policy | **implemented** on the station: an unowned ESP32 accepts the first verified, uncarried `cmd:set owner:` naming its own sender and writes the key into its allow-list; an owner sets `use:`, `first:` and `serve:` the same way, each answered with all four as they now stand; `use:` is enforced at the door a phone hands a packet through, with `t:sos` and `t:warning` exempt; `first:` ranks the queue through a hook the bearer takes; a policy command not strictly newer than the last accepted is `408`; `q:policy` is answered to anybody. An unowned station airs `q:owner scope:local` on its local bearers every two minutes, signed, and stops on being claimed. The codec side is implemented in `lib/services/xprs/xprs_station_policy.dart`, which also records the stations heard asking; no user interface offers the claim yet |
| Section 13.1 relay budget, 13.2 loop check | **implemented** in the codec (`xprsMayRelay`, `xprsWouldLoop`); nothing transmits `via:` yet, so nothing calls them on the air |
| Section 13.11.3, `scope:local` is never carried | **implemented**; refused at custody admission in `MeshCustodyDelegate` |
| Section 36.8.1 automated return leg (release on hearing, forward toward gossip) | **implemented** on the Flutter node (funnel-triggered release, `XprsForwarder` with `via:` and the loop check) and in the shared ESP32 app (release-on-hearing off the seen funnel, paced re-air, receipt purge); the T-Dongle keeps its original `blemesh_scf_*` loop. Bench-validated end to end |
| Section 36.9.4 gossip (layers, budgets, super-archivers) | **implemented** on the Flutter side (`xprs_gossip.dart`: L2/L3 tables, K/G caps, signer quotas, byte budget, the super-archiver mode and the miss-path ask) with DoS-probe unit tests; the shared ESP32 app keeps the need-to-know ring |
| Section 36.12 reaching a callsign from anywhere | **implemented and bench-validated**: an internet sender on a foreign network reached a WiFi-less BLE-only pocket through deposit, gossip, forward and release-on-hearing, with signatures intact at every hop |
| Section 36.12.1 constrained internet transports (directed replies, directed asks, deposit, sender-parks-own-mail) | **implemented** on the Flutter side; specified after being proven necessary on public hubs |
| Section 36.10.2 the poll adapts to what it finds (per-archiver interval, the quiet ladder, the peer's floor, 429 as authority) | **implemented** on the Flutter side, with the ladder as pure functions under unit test; bench-measured 600s down to the 15s floor under load and back up to the ceiling when the room went quiet |
| Section 25.2.1 a continuation must make progress | specified in this revision after both halves failed on the bench; the asker's half (a stalled resume is not news) is **implemented** on the Flutter side, the responder's `until:` half is not yet |
| Section 36.9.4 what claiming `super` commits a station to | specified in this revision -- written while planning the ESP32 super-archiver, where no board yet meets it |
| Section 36.12.2 public traffic across the internet (push to chosen archivers, pull from them, publications past the declaration rule, callsign-to-address resolution) | **implemented and bench-validated**: two phones on different networks, neither hearing the other's broadcasts, exchanged Global chat through one super-archiver -- push arrived in seconds, pull on the metering period |
| Callsigns, signatures, verification | implemented |
| Signing by default on every packet type | not implemented; signing exists and is opt-in |
| Direct, group and broadcast messages | implemented |
| Replies and reactions | implemented |
| Receipts and carrier release | implemented, for receipts that were asked for with `q:` |
| Section 36.7, an archiver holding mail | **specified, not implemented** as an archiver role, but the parts are live elsewhere: `MeshStore` already parks a frame for an absent station and releases it on delivery, and the LXMF propagation mailbox already holds what could not be pushed and serves it when the recipient pulls. What is missing is an archiver being a station's declared `hold:` and telling a recipient that something is waiting |
| Section 36, publishing to chosen archivers | **specified, not implemented.** Every piece it is built from exists -- the signed-record discipline, the append-only log with an (epoch, seq) cursor, archiver-to-archiver catch-up and archivers as the DHT's anchors are all live for FILES (`files/dht/`, `social/relay_node.dart`) -- but nothing yet keeps a publication log, pushes packets to a chosen archiver, or answers a query from their fields. The section deliberately adds no packet type and no key, so there is nothing on the wire to implement: the work is all plumbing |
| Section 36.1, gateway reachability publications (`observation`/`identity` to an archiver) | **specified, not implemented** as a push; the raw material is live -- every phone beacons `hears:` and the ESP32 digipeats -- but no gateway publishes its observation to an archiver and no archiver answers for one |
| Section 36.6, `only:` matching inside list fields | **partly implemented**: the shipped history responder matches `only:` against author and addressee (`xprs_archive.dart` query); `hears:`/`hold:`/`via:`/`grant:` containment is not searched yet |
| Section 36.8, sealed-mail release to a hearing gateway | **specified, not implemented**; the nearest live relatives are the chat iGate mailbox (mail pulled from APRS-IS by an in-range station) and MeshStore custody, neither of which is driven by a published `hears:` claim |
| Section 36.9, `serve:archive` and the XDIR1 directory exchange | **specified, not implemented**; the philosophy already ships for files -- `pointer_sync.dart` gossips signed ADDRESSES between file-archivers and re-verifies on merge, never copying content -- but no station publishes a callsign directory or answers a miss with `m:try` |
| Section 9.2.1, redacted packets (`xr:`) | **specified, not implemented**; the sealed-body `x:` machinery is live, the partial-redaction profile is not -- no composer parses `((...))` and nothing derives the slow key yet |
| Section 23.7, working-channel invitations | **specified, not implemented** as packets; the dance itself ships in binary for one pair of bearers -- the WiFi-Direct negotiation (BLE subtype `0x57` ADVERT/REQ/OFFER, `docs/ble5.md`) coordinates exactly this move from the shared advert channel to a private fast lane -- and 23.7 is that handshake generalised to every bearer, in text, signed |
| Section 3.1, one person on several devices | **specified, not implemented.** Nothing numbers a device today: a station wears its bare callsign, and the chat wapp matches `d:` against that alone. The pieces the rule needs are already on the air -- a beacon carries `f:` and `lx:`, so a device can see a sibling and tell it apart -- but no code adopts a suffix, prefers the conventional number for its `type:`, or refuses a command addressed to a person |
| Section 13.7.1, receipts signed by default | **specified, not implemented.** Signing exists (section 9.1) and receipts do not use it yet, which leaves the forged-`s:ack` deletion described there open on any station that honours the section 7 carrier release. The Reticulum side is not exposed to it -- its acknowledgement is a link, not an XPRS packet -- but an XPRS-native carrier would be |
| Section 13.7.2, parking a retry with no evidence | **implemented** on the Reticulum side: a retry is spent only against a live path or a beacon heard in the last three minutes (`RnsService._peerReachable`), otherwise the entry parks without burning a rung and the copy stays held |
| Section 13.7.1, receipts without asking | **specified, not yet on the air.** The rule and its exclusions are settled and the two example packets are test fixtures; no station sends an unasked `s:ack` yet. What made it necessary is fixed already on the Reticulum side: an unacknowledged single-packet delivery no longer reports itself as delivered, and the sender retries at 20s/60s/5min before leaving the copy held (`lxmf_router.dart`) |
| Long messages in parts | implemented |
| Encryption and the sealed-body band rule | implemented |
| Section 9.4.1, no self-generated callsign onto licensed spectrum | not implemented, and violated today: the ESP32 iGate computes an APRS-IS passcode for an `X3` callsign and states in `esp32/components/geogram_aprsis/aprsis.h` that no licence is needed for one |
| Section 9.4.2, an issued callsign bound to a key by `t:identity` | partly; the announcement is built and aired (9.3), but no user interface offers to enter a licensed callsign, so the binding is only ever for a derived one |
| File references by content hash | **implemented**, in the base64url form this document now specifies (`MediaRef`); the older 64-hex form is still read |
| Identity announcement | implemented |
| `key:value` fields separated by spaces | **implemented** everywhere the device transmits: the beacon, carried mail, and the chat wapp since 0.4.38. The three-`0x1F`-field frame remains only as a fallback that is still read, and that chat still sends for its control frames |
| `t:` packet type as the first field | **implemented**; chat's own routing (a callsign, a `#group`, `!` for a position, empty for in-range) is now expressed as `t:` plus `d:`, not inferred from one overloaded field |
| Derived identifiers | not implemented; the current wire hashes message content without a timestamp, so every `OK` collides, and carries a separate receipt identifier |
| `ts:` on messages | **implemented** on the chat wire since 0.4.38: a message now states when it was written, so one that waited in a mailbox no longer shows the minute it arrived. A packet with no `ts:` is still read (section 10.7) |
| `q:` and `s:` | not implemented; receipts exist, requests do not |
| `via:` instead of rewriting `f:` | not implemented; a carrier currently retransmits under its own callsign, which breaks both authorship and the identifier |
| Relay limit by packet type | not implemented; custody re-airs a fixed three times with no path recorded |
| `t:track` tracks | not implemented; no track is recorded or published |
| `t:sos` calls for help | not implemented; the current wire has an `sos` station symbol, which is a different thing and is not relayed further than any other packet |
| `t:warning` warnings | not implemented; no source |
| `t:info` notices | not implemented; no source |
| `t:blog` posts | not implemented |
| `wave`, `swell`, `seatemp`, `vis` | not implemented; no source |
| `t:passage`, `t:event`, `t:offer`, `t:need` | not implemented |
| `price:` | not implemented |
| `cw:` content warnings | not implemented |
| `t:channel` | not implemented |
| Carrying toward a place (`dest:` on a message) | not implemented; custody currently carries only to a known callsign |
| `urg:` | not implemented |
| `scope:` | not implemented; every bearer currently forwards everything it can |
| `lang:` | not implemented |
| `nick:` and signed identity | not implemented; identity is announced unsigned today |
| `t:mailbox` | **partly implemented**: a receiving station records verified declarations naming it (windows and `remove:mailbox` included, `lib/services/xprs/xprs_archive.dart`) and uses them to gate what the internet lane may deposit in its spool; no station composes one yet, and custody still has no notion of a preferred carrier |
| Several mailboxes with windows, and cancellation | **implemented on the receiving side** (see `t:mailbox` above); not composed |
| `t:service` | not implemented; no station advertises what it does |
| `t:command` and `t:result` | **implemented** for `cmd:history`: the phone and desktop host answer a command addressed to them with signed results (`lib/services/xprs/xprs_history_server.dart`); no other command is acted on yet |
| `cmd:history`, backfill by replay | **implemented**: every device keeps a spool by default (500 MB or a year, the owner's numbers per section 31.3) and re-airs the original packets newest first on request -- `code:202`, the page, then `code:200` or `code:206` -- metered per section 31.2 and paced for the advert channel |
| `cmd:file`, fetching bytes by hash | **specified** (with `off:` resume and concrete reply codes, section 25.2), not implemented as a command; the resolution ladder underneath it is built and works (Reticulum direct, DHT, LAN, I2P, BitTorrent -- `reticulum-dart/doc/file-sharing.md`), so this is an ask the format lacked rather than a transport it lacks |
| `cmd:put`, depositing bytes | **specified, not implemented** as a command; the machinery exists as the Reticulum deposit session (`FileDepositSession`) and the MSP bulk lane's accept-at-size handshake -- what is missing is the XPRS ask in front of them |
| `q:have` / `s:have`, who holds a file | **specified, not implemented**; the internet overlay's equivalent (signed DHT provider records) is live, the radio-side question is not asked yet |
| Listings (`XFL1`), folders as snapshots | **specified, not implemented** in this format; the shipped folders lane keeps piece hashes as a headerless binary blob and syncs live folders by signed op-log -- the XFL1 text listing is the packet-layer snapshot form |
| Inline files in `b:` | **specified, not implemented**; nothing splits or reassembles `b:` yet |
| Deterministic torrents, `ih:` derivable | **implemented** (`lib/services/torrent_service.dart` builds byte-identical torrents from content, so every holder derives one infohash) |
| `serve:archive` | **implemented**: the spool is on by default and the discovery beacon says so; turning the preference off drops the claim and the answers together |
| Section 24.4, one port for Reticulum and XPRS | **implemented** on the TCP hub listener: port 4242 answers HDLC-framed Reticulum and line-oriented XPRS on one socket, told apart by the first byte |
| Retention policy, and keeping by worth rather than by age | deliberately unspecified (section 31.3); the shipping custody store bounds itself at 100 MB or 7 days and evicts `ORDER BY urg, ts`, which is exactly the kind of local decision this format leaves alone |
| Paged replies, `code:206` | **implemented** by the history responder: twelve packets a page over the air, the probe row deciding 206 against 200, and the requester continuing by moving `until:` |
| `t:poll` and `vote:` | not implemented; nothing puts a question or counts an answer |
| `@CALLSIGN` mentions | not implemented; no wapp scans `m:` for them and nothing notifies on being named |
| `root:` on a reply | not implemented; the chat wapp threads by parent pointer only (`docs/aprs-xt.md`), so a lost middle orphans the rest |
| `t:file` and `size:` (now also `name:`, `ph:`, `kind:folder`, `count:`) | not implemented as a packet; the equivalent exists as NOSTR kind-1063 metadata indexed in FTS5 (`reticulum-dart/doc/file-sharing.md`) |
| `link:`, `busy:` and `txtime:` | not implemented; the Reticulum side tracks announce cadence and the LoRa drivers know the duty cycle, but nothing measures or publishes channel occupancy |
| `hears:` | not implemented; `hal_rns_nodes` lists observed nodes but, per `docs/store-and-forward.md`, a hub replays its whole announce cache so the list is not "heard directly" |
| `t:report` | not implemented; the chat wapp has moderation ops but no way for an ordinary station to flag anything |
| `add:repost` | not implemented; the chat wapp has reactions (`add:like`) and no repost |
| `t:place` | not implemented; nothing in the codebase reports a thing that is not the sender |
| Avatar and description on `t:identity` | not implemented; the Social wapp renders NOSTR kind-0 profiles, which are a different mechanism |
| Section 31, airtime | not implemented as stated here, though the Reticulum side has real cadences (30 s charging, 5 min on battery) and the NOSTR side has stranger-serving budgets |
| `t:status` | not implemented; the Social wapp has a feed, but it is NOSTR kind-1 notes over the internet and Reticulum rather than XPRS packets (`docs/social.md`) |
| `mood:` and client theming | not implemented; nothing reads a mood and no client changes appearance for one |
| `X5` group callsigns and `t:moderate` | not implemented; groups are plain names with no member list anywhere |
| Subgroups, `role:sub` nested five levels deep | not implemented; the chat wapp has a sub-room tree, but on NOSTR rooms and with authority inherited down the tree rather than stopping at each key |
| Never filtering `sos`, `warning` and `info` by membership | not implemented; there is no membership filter to exempt them from |
| The chat wapp's own moderation | **implemented, and by a different design**: NIP-72 rooms with a NOSTR kind-9078 op-log, authority from the room event's author rather than a group keypair, and no roster at all (`docs/chat-rooms.md`). Nothing in section 26 is built, and reconciling the two is not attempted here |
| `cmd:interpret` | not implemented; no station interprets natural language |
| `near:`, regional delivery, `route:` in a receipt | not implemented |
| `q:sign` and signed receipts | not implemented |
| Recurring windows, `site:`, `supply:`, `range:` | not implemented |
| `t:challenge` and `t:response` | not implemented; no challenge exists, and a spoofed authority-issued callsign is currently undetectable |
| Periodic `t:identity` | implemented; self-signed, aired on every active bearer at start and every 30 minutes (18.1), and `q:identity` is answered directly |
| `since:` and `until:` | not implemented; nothing in the current wire carries an event duration, and nothing expires on its own |
| `type:` vehicle set | partly; the current wire carries a handful of symbols and none of the rail, air or cycle values |
| Variable-length and authority-issued callsigns | not implemented; the current wire assumes the six-character `X1`/`X3` form |
| `pos:` coordinates | implemented in a different encoding |
| `age:` and `epoch:` time | not implemented; requires an epoch counter in non-volatile storage |
| `alt`, `acc`, `spd`, `dir`, `o`, `climb` movement | not implemented; the platform supplies these values and the location layer currently retains only latitude and longitude |
| `temp`, `hum` weather | one hardware sensor exists and reaches a local display only |
| `intemp`, `inhum` weather | not implemented; the one sensor that exists is indoors and is reported as if it were outdoors |
| `press`, `wind`, `wdir`, `gust`, `rain1`, `rain24`, `solar` weather | no source |
| `batt`, `volt` telemetry | not implemented; charging state is tracked, charge level is not |
| `rssi`, `snr` telemetry | implemented on the receive paths |
| `uptime`, `lifetime` telemetry | implemented on the ESP32 T-Dongle beacon (`esp32/rns_ble5`, lifetime accumulated in NVS); the phone beacon does not carry them yet |
| `dose`, `lifedose`, `radon`, `rf`, `efield`, `mfield` radiation (section 10.5.1), `odometer` | specified; no shipping station has a sensor for any of them yet |
